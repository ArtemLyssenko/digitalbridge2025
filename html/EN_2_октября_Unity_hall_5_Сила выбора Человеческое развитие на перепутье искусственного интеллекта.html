      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session presented key findings of the 2025 Human Development Report on the role of AI: despite historically high levels of human development, progress is slowing and gaps are widening. The complementary "human+AI" model, risks of bias, and mental health were discussed. Kazakhstan showcased systemic steps — integrating AI into education, research infrastructure, pilots of government AI agents, and a new AI law; Korea shared its national strategy and infrastructure investments. The common call is for human-centered and inclusive AI deployment so that no one is left behind.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Present the findings of the 2025 Human Development Report on the impact of AI on education, healthcare, and public administration</li>
<li>Assess AI risks and opportunities with an emphasis on complementarity and reducing inequality</li>
<li>Share Kazakhstan's national practices in workforce development, infrastructure, regulation, and AI applications</li>
<li>Discuss the Republic of Korea's international experience in implementing the national AI strategy</li>
<li>Agree on benchmarks for next steps toward human-centered and safe AI deployment</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How can we reconcile accelerating AI innovation with the 'human at the center' principle and prioritizing augmentation rather than replacement?</li>
<li>What mechanisms are needed to reduce AI model bias and the growth of global inequality?</li>
<li>How should AI regulation be designed in the absence of strict international standards — where is the line between local norms and global coordination?</li>
<li>How can we protect personal data, content rights, and counter deepfakes amid mass AI deployment?</li>
<li>What training and reskilling models will ensure broad digital literacy and demand for new professions?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>HDR‑2025 records a historically high level of human development, but the slowest progress in recent years and a widening gap between countries.</li>
<li>Global surveys: in countries with low HDI there are high expectations for active AI use; users more often expect AI to augment labor than to fully automate it.</li>
<li>Generative models carry cultural and geographic data biases (greater correlation with the views of high‑HDI countries), which is important to account for in automation.</li>
<li>AI can amplify creativity and science (the AlphaGo case — a surge in players' mastery; applications for predicting protein structures and drug discovery).</li>
<li>A worrying trend in youth mental health coincides with the widespread adoption of digital technologies — this requires close study.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan has integrated AI into the curricula of 95 universities; 30 universities run 38 specialized programs; 54% of faculty have completed AI upskilling.</li>
<li>Infrastructure initiatives launched: AI centers and labs, an academic supercomputer cluster is being formed and a unified access network for research.</li>
<li>Large‑scale training is underway: 440 thousand students have completed courses; the plan is to train 1 million citizens; the national AI platform and pilots of 50 AI agents for government agencies have been deployed.</li>
<li>Legal regulation in the Republic of Kazakhstan: an adopted AI law with a risk‑based approach, bans on remote biometrics without consent, emotion recognition, and discriminatory scoring; copyright — training is permissible, a machine‑readable opt‑out is introduced, and creative prompts may be recognized as protectable objects.</li>
<li>Experience of the Republic of Korea: a national AI 'control tower', 100 trillion won for infrastructure (including 50 thousand GPUs), training 1 million specialists, priorities in SMEs and public services; emphasis on regional pilots (e.g., «Цифровая Кызылорда»).</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Artificial intelligence as a partner, but by no means artificial intelligence as a replacement.” — <span class="author">Yekaterina Smyshlyaeva</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In three years, people who cannot use artificial intelligence will be roughly the same as someone today who cannot use the Internet.” — <span class="author">Dmitriy Mun</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We want to be among the world's top three powers in artificial intelligence by 2030.” — <span class="author">Von-San Cha</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI can accelerate human development with a human‑centered, complementary approach and by addressing risks of bias and privacy.</li>
<li>In the absence of strict international norms, high‑quality national regulation, infrastructure, and mass workforce training play a key role.</li>
<li>Inclusiveness is a critical success criterion: the benefits of AI must reach regions, SMEs, and vulnerable groups so as not to exacerbate inequality.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Support a focus on the complementary "human+AI" model and the human‑centered principle reflected in HDR‑2025.</li>
<li>Hold an open workshop on the draft «Цифровой кодекс» (including AI and data provisions) for the professional community.</li>
<li>Scale up pilots of the national AI platform and AI agents in government agencies based on current results.</li>
<li>Strengthen regional pilots and cooperation with the Republic of Korea (including «Цифровая Кызылорда») to support SMEs and local communities.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Publish a localized HDR‑2025 digest for government bodies, universities, and businesses with practical recommendations.</li>
<li>Develop methodological guidelines for human‑centered AI deployment in public services (including risk assessment and data quality).</li>
<li>Launch a registry of machine‑readable opt‑outs for authors on the use of their content in training AI models, and an enforcement mechanism.</li>
<li>Expand the academic supercomputer cluster and provide network access to all universities for AI research.</li>
<li>Continue the large‑scale training program (students, civil servants, SMEs) with a focus on practical creation and use of AI agents.</li>
<li>Prepare and implement standards to counter deepfakes and protect personal data in educational and government organizations.</li>
<li>Deploy monitoring of the impact of digital technologies on youth mental health and prevention measures at the education system level.</li></ul>
