      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel focused on why it is beneficial for strategics to buy startups and how this accelerates ecosystem transformation. A global and regional pivot toward growth in M&A was noted, as well as the example of the Freedom Super App as a model of ecosystem gravity. Казахтелеком disclosed the mechanics of partnerships and readiness to acquire mature solutions, Pasha Holding — corporate incubation and venture clienting. The failures of the venture capital infrastructure in the region and the need for institutional LPs and funds of funds were discussed.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Articulate the role of strategic buyers in the growth of startups and Central Asian ecosystems</li>
<li>Show criteria for evaluating and integrating startups (audience, market share, talent, synergies)</li>
<li>Discuss the venture capital infrastructure and ways to attract institutional LPs</li>
<li>Identify models of cooperation between corporations and startups (bundle sales, venture clienting, accelerators)</li>
<li>Define preparatory steps for startups toward successful M&A deals</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Why is it more advantageous for corporations to buy startups rather than build solutions in-house?</li>
<li>How should strategics assess a startup's value: market share, audience LTV, team, or financial dynamics?</li>
<li>Which integration approaches allow preserving the founders' culture and teams?</li>
<li>What regulatory and institutional barriers hinder the emergence of a full-fledged VC market in Kazakhstan?</li>
<li>Can «Казахтелеком» act as a strategic buyer, and on what terms?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The global M&A market is reviving: in Q1 2025 growth is about 25%, 98 deals worth $100+ billion; regional deals have also picked up.</li>
<li>Freedom's strategy: buy mature services with audience and market share (Aviata, PayBox, Ticketon, Arbuz) to increase Super App gravity and cross-sell into high-margin financial services.</li>
<li>Ecosystem effect: standalone businesses find it harder to survive; the second player in a niche survives if it becomes part of a strong ecosystem.</li>
<li>Talent as the core value: 'people decide everything'—acquiring strong teams and founders justifies high valuations at early stages.</li>
<li>Казахтелеком, via Activation Hub, builds industry tracks and bundle sales of startups in B2B/B2G/B2C; examples: AI therapist ASKOL (30 polyclinics), video badges for feldshers.</li>
<li>Казахтелеком is ready to consider purchases of mature startups and is already a channel to government customers; the plan is fiber to 3,000 villages and growth of the customer base.</li>
<li>Pasha Holding develops corporate innovation (incubation of 20k+ employees, venture clienting, events) and has executed deals (marketplace «Компето», wallet M10).</li>
<li>The region lacks a foundation for VC: there are no institutional LPs (pension, banks) due to regulatory restrictions; the market remains a 'statistical margin of error.'</li>
<li>MA7: M&A is key to speed and pivoting; startups attract and retain talent more effectively via options, creating products 'cheaper and faster' than corporations.</li>
<li>Ecosystem metrics and traffic monetization are critical: an audience is valuable only when converted into high-margin products; trust and taking greater long-term risk matter.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Habit is a very powerful thing: even the best interface does not always seem convenient until you get used to it.” — <span class="author">Timur Turlov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The second player in the market is unlikely to survive unless they become part of an ecosystem.” — <span class="author">Timur Turlov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The short answer is yes: «Казахтелеком» can be a strategic and a buyer of mature solutions.” — <span class="author">Bagdat Musin</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“It's one thing to take a bigger slice of the pie; it's another to increase the pie itself.” — <span class="author">Gusein Makhmudov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In Kazakhstan, the financial base of venture capital effectively does not exist—pension funds and banks are practically prohibited from investing.” — <span class="author">Almas Chukin</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Corporations buy speed and talent—it's a way to pivot quickly and change strategy.” — <span class="author">Elzhan Kushekbayev</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>An ecosystem strategy and targeted M&A create 'gravity' for customers and teams, accelerating growth and monetization.</li>
<li>State and quasi-state sector players can become effective scaling channels for startups through bundle sales and B2G.</li>
<li>The VC market needs institutional LPs and regulatory changes to flourish; without them the market volume will remain small.</li>
<li>Cross-country partnerships (Kazakhstan–Azerbaijan–Uzbekistan) expand the sales market and increase the chances of sustainable exits.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>«Казахтелеком» confirms readiness to consider acquisitions of mature startups and to scale them through existing sales channels (B2B/B2G/B2C).</li>
<li>«Казахтелеком» will continue the work of Activation Hub and industry pilots (including ASKOL and video badges) with an eye to replication.</li>
<li>Pasha Holding maintains its course on corporate innovation and venture clienting and opens doors for startups from Kazakhstan to the Azerbaijan market.</li>
<li>Freedom concentrates efforts on deep integration of acquired services into the Super App and will apply M&A where ecosystem gravity is strengthened.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Form a working group on 'ecosystem' metrics (retention, interaction frequency, cross-sell) and their regular publication to the market.</li>
<li>Initiate a dialogue on regulatory changes to admit institutional LPs (pension funds, insurers) into VC and funds of funds.</li>
<li>Prepare an M&A playbook for startups: financial and technical documentation, compliance, HR/ESOP, integration plan, and synergy KPIs.</li>
<li>Expand pilots with «Казахтелеком» in eHealth and security (scaling ASKOL, implementing video badges) and prepare bundled offers for B2G.</li>
<li>Launch a cross-border funnel (Kazakhstan–Azerbaijan–Uzbekistan): a startup roadshow with the participation of Pasha Holding, Freedom, Kazakhtelecom.</li>
<li>Develop a channel for bundle sales of startup services through the infrastructure of «Казахтелеком» for 100k B2B and 2 million B2C customers.</li></ul>
