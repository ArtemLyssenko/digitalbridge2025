      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>We discussed how Kaspi achieved ~75% population reach and a uniquely broad range of services: a bet on quality, trust, and product discipline in a small market with no 'second chance.' We unpacked the internal product factory: a three-page brief, testing 'on ourselves,' launch in 3–6 months, and continuous NPS cycles. We showed key growth vectors — SMEs via the Kaspi platform and end-to-end application of AI with the human-in-the-loop principle. International expansion confirmed: launching Kaspi services in Turkey based on the country's second-largest e-commerce platform.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Understand the factors behind Kaspi’s durable success and trust in the Kazakhstan market</li>
<li>Unpack Kaspi’s process for developing and launching products without 'raw' MVPs</li>
<li>Identify areas for further growth: SMEs, new services, and overseas markets</li>
<li>Show practices and principles for implementing AI, including ethics and the human role</li>
<li>Outline organizational approaches to metrics, quality, and accountability</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What are the key reasons for Kaspi’s phenomenal success and reach?</li>
<li>Why doesn’t Kaspi release 'raw' products, and how is the internal lab organized?</li>
<li>Where is the potential for further growth within Kazakhstan given the high penetration?</li>
<li>How is responsibility for financial metrics and KPIs distributed in the company?</li>
<li>How and where does Kaspi use artificial intelligence, and when will the company become global?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Service quality and customer trust are the foundation of a multi-product platform; in a small market there is no second chance.</li>
<li>Kaspi deliberately does not roll out raw functionality: experiments are run 'on ourselves,' not on customers.</li>
<li>A three-page document in plain language is the entry filter for launch: current experience, target experience, FAQ, business requirements.</li>
<li>Average service rollout cycle is 3–6 months; thereafter — continuous improvements and NPS measurement every three months.</li>
<li>Strong growth focus — SMEs: marketplace, advertising, delivery, machines/kiosks, and technological infrastructure.</li>
<li>Most employees are oriented toward product and quality; financial health is controlled by a narrow circle of top management.</li>
<li>About 2–2.5 thousand specialists are involved in building and supporting products: engineers, data scientists, designers.</li>
<li>AI is applied everywhere in decision-making: cash forecasting for ATMs, delivery route optimization, etc.</li>
<li>Human-in-the-loop principle: AI is an assistant; the final decision remains with the user/employee.</li>
<li>Expansion: the second-largest e-commerce platform in Turkey has been acquired; groundwork is being laid to launch Kaspi services.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We prefer to run experiments on ourselves.” — <span class="author">Mikhail Lomtadze</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The simplest description of artificial intelligence and its goal is the accuracy of predicting the next action.” — <span class="author">Mikhail Lomtadze</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In Kazakhstan, if, say, a million customers don’t like you, you have no chance to launch the next product.” — <span class="author">Mikhail Lomtadze</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“If you can’t explain in plain language what you want to do... then you don’t understand it yourself.” — <span class="author">Mikhail Lomtadze</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We use a virtual assistant in our communications with our customers, but we always introduce ourselves.” — <span class="author">Mikhail Lomtadze</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>A strategy of quality and simplicity is key to scaling a super app in a small market and is the basis of trust.</li>
<li>A systematic product process and a data-driven AI approach ensure sustainable growth and expansion into SMEs.</li>
<li>Global expansion has started with Turkey; the Kaspi model is being prepared for transfer to other markets.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Confirmed refusal to release 'raw' products and continuation of testing new features on internal users.</li>
<li>Maintain the human-in-the-loop principle: AI is an assistant; final decisions are made by humans.</li>
<li>Continue scaling services for SMEs via the Kaspi platform (marketplace, delivery, advertising, machines).</li>
<li>Ensure transparency in customer interactions: the virtual assistant is always identified as a robot.</li>
<li>Accelerate the launch of Kaspi services in Turkey based on the acquired e-commerce platform.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Complete and launch the Kaspi services platform in Turkey for customers and partners.</li>
<li>Prepare and bring to market Kaspi AI tools for customers and SME partners.</li>
<li>Expand offerings for SMEs: logistics, advertising, payment automation, and access to Kaspi infrastructure.</li>
<li>Continue quarterly cycles of improvements in NPS and quality, strengthening feedback collection and analysis.</li>
<li>Strengthen data science and product development teams in Kazakhstan to scale AI solutions.</li></ul>
