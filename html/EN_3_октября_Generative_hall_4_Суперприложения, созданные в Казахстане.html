      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>Leaders of Freedom, inDrive, and Kaspi discussed how Kazakhstan’s super apps scale audience and revenue and enter new markets. Different strategic approaches were highlighted: proprietary services vs partner integrations, and “Fair Play” as inDrive’s philosophy. Plans for international expansion (Central Asia, the Caucasus, Turkey) and new verticals were voiced — from foodtech and fintech to education and healthcare. A separate emphasis was placed on the role of regulation and ecosystem cooperation.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Define sustainable models for growth and monetization of super apps in Kazakhstan and abroad</li>
<li>Compare strategies: owning services vs partner integrations within super apps</li>
<li>Discuss priority verticals for scaling (fintech, foodtech, health, education)</li>
<li>Identify barriers and opportunities for international expansion considering regulation</li>
<li>Show the social and ethical dimension (Fair Play, access to technology, eco projects)</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to maintain a high growth pace and company valuation in a small domestic market?</li>
<li>How replicable is the Kazakhstani super app model in foreign markets with different regulation?</li>
<li>What exactly is “Kazakhstani” in inDrive’s global product and its super app?</li>
<li>How to combine proprietary services and partner integrations within one app space?</li>
<li>Which next-generation verticals (health, education) will become ecosystem drivers?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Freedom: ~11 million ecosystem customers; SuperApp MAU 1.6–1.7 million, installs >3 million; VAU is close to MAU, indicating high frequency of use.</li>
<li>Freedom’s revenue mix is diversified: ~30% bank, ~30% brokerage, ~30% insurance; rapid customer flow into the SuperApp and 10% m/m metric growth in core banking.</li>
<li>Freedom’s international expansion: launching a bank in Tajikistan (setup from scratch), preparing licenses in a number of Central Asia and Caucasus markets; regulation is the main barrier.</li>
<li>Freedom thesis: SuperApp is a working universal model; surviving in stand‑alone banking/insurance will become increasingly difficult.</li>
<li>inDrive: ~60 million MAU in 48 countries; the largest R&D/operational hub in Kazakhstan (~1,000 employees) builds solutions for the whole world.</li>
<li>inDrive Super App strategy — “Fair Play”: entering domains with imbalances in fairness/access (foodtech via dark stores, shopping including «Рядом»; fintech loans to gig_workers at local bank rates in 6 countries, but not in Kazakhstan due to over‑indebtedness).</li>
<li>inDrive’s social initiatives from Kazakhstan to the world: «Дом Мамы», EnvisionU (leadership school), anti‑smog projects (Almaty; considering Lahore/Kathmandu).</li>
<li>Kaspi: develops the super app through customer demand and partnerships; integrated Glovo (after an unsuccessful experience with Chocofood), with an emphasis on NPS and operational quality.</li>
<li>Kaspi strengthens its position in Turkey (Hepsiburada is the second‑largest marketplace by traffic; approval of the purchase of a small bank for financial services), with a focus on KZ–TR cross‑border trade and fast deliveries.</li>
<li>The next wave of verticals: health and education — digital clinics, AI assistants for patients and doctors, EdTech partnerships (e.g., with Bilim Media), individualized learning paths and anti‑cheating.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“SuperApp is an almost unique way to survive; in stand‑alone banking or insurance, surviving will be almost impossible.” — <span class="author">Timur Turlov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We are building a Fair Play Super App — services based on the idea of honesty and fairness.” — <span class="author">Arsen Tomsky</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“If our customers love a service, it will be in our app.” — <span class="author">Mikhail Lomtadze</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In Kazakhstan, we were in the top 3 by downloads in the App Store for ten months in a row.” — <span class="author">Timur Turlov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Kazakhstan will always be Kaspi’s home.” — <span class="author">Mikhail Lomtadze</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Kazakhstani super apps are moving from product bundles to platforms with social value and international scale.</li>
<li>Hybrid models (owning services + partner integrations) increase the speed and quality of the offering, while the customer’s voice remains decisive.</li>
<li>Regulation is a key factor in expansion; successful adaptation requires localization, but the core of the customer experience can be ported.</li>
<li>New verticals (health, education) and AI tools will become the next growth levers for ecosystems.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Kaspi scales the Glovo integration inside the app given positive user feedback.</li>
<li>Freedom finalizes the bank launch in Tajikistan and continues obtaining licenses in the Central Asia and Caucasus markets, replicating the superapp model.</li>
<li>inDrive ramps up the foodtech direction through dark stores and M&A (including «Рядом») and expands fintech lending to gig_workers in international locations (without launching in Kazakhstan).</li>
<li>Kaspi and Hepsiburada accelerate cross‑border trade between Kazakhstan and Turkey with a focus on delivery speed.</li>
<li>Ecosystems strengthen cooperation with technology partners (example: Kaspi–Яндекс in express delivery).</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Freedom: finalize regulatory approvals and the bank’s go‑live in Tajikistan; prepare a phased release of products (bank, brokerage, insurance) and customer onboarding into the SuperApp.</li>
<li>Freedom: launch pilots in the health and education verticals (digital clinic, AI assistants, school diary/kids’ cards with Bilim Media) and success metrics (MAU/retention/NPS).</li>
<li>Kaspi: run a wave of communications and promo for the Glovo integration, implement an improvement cycle based on NPS/CSAT, and ensure SLA jointly with the partner.</li>
<li>Kaspi: advance obtaining a banking license in Turkey and prepare a package of fintech products for Hepsiburada, including solutions for cross‑border payments and seller financing.</li>
<li>inDrive: scale «Рядом» and dark stores to new districts and cities; standardize operational KPIs (assortment, freshness, 15‑minute delivery).</li>
<li>inDrive: expand the geography of lending to gig_workers at bank rates and strengthen scoring based on platform data.</li>
<li>inDrive: determine the next wave of cities for anti‑smog initiatives (evaluating Lahore/Kathmandu), form partnerships with municipalities and NGOs.</li>
<li>For regulators: simplify and make fintech/bank licensing more transparent to enable the expansion of Kazakhstani ecosystems, and implement sandbox mechanisms for pilots.</li></ul>
