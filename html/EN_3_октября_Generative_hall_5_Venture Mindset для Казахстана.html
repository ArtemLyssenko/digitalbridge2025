      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>Discussed the role of venture capital in long-term growth and the scale Kazakhstan/Central Asia needs (tens of billions of dollars under management). Broke down startup strategy: go to global markets immediately, especially in the AI-first era. Considered how the state and corporations can apply venture principles, including proactive regulation and properly structured CVCs. Showed how to connect science and Астана Хаб to grow deep tech through interdisciplinarity and commercialization of university research.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Define scale benchmarks for the venture industry in Kazakhstan and Central Asia</li>
<li>Formulate a strategy for the region’s startups to enter global markets</li>
<li>Demonstrate the applicability of venture thinking to state regulators and policymakers</li>
<li>Assess the role and conditions for the effectiveness of corporate venture funds (CVC)</li>
<li>Outline the integration of science, universities, and Астана Хаб to grow deep tech</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How much venture capital and how many funds does the Kazakhstan/Central Asia market need for the ecosystem to be viable and not overheated?</li>
<li>Build the product locally or go straight to global markets given the region’s limited capacity?</li>
<li>Are the principles of venture thinking applicable to Kazakhstan’s state regulators?</li>
<li>Do Kazakhstani corporations need CVCs, and under what conditions do they work?</li>
<li>How to connect science and education with Астана Хаб to increase the number of science-intensive startups?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>7 out of the 10 largest US companies by market capitalization were financed by venture capital; VC’s contribution has been significant, including to the US economy’s outperformance since the 1980s</li>
<li>Kazakhstan/Central Asia needs a full capital funnel from angel stages to growth/private equity; the scale is at least “several tens of billions of dollars” under management</li>
<li>Case Хиксвилд AI: seeded in Kazakhstan, but achieved unicorn status in the US — to grow “home” unicorns, a developed local financing ladder is necessary</li>
<li>Global > local: in the new wave (especially AI-first) products are aimed at global markets from the outset; startups in the region should go global from day one</li>
<li>Regulators should think like venture investors: proactively get “outside the four walls,” seek business needs and technologies, rather than wait for inbound requests</li>
<li>CVCs work if built by “venture norms”: do not focus on quarterly ROI, accept high risk, do not expect every deal to succeed</li>
<li>Three key CVC functions: defending the core, aggressive expansion into new markets/models, information radar (regular trend analytics for HQ)</li>
<li>Typical CVC mistakes: top management’s lack of understanding of venture norms; expectations of quick returns; excessive operational control — many CVCs do not survive to 3 years</li>
<li>The linkage between universities and hubs is critical: interdisciplinarity, campus proximity, and encouraging professors’ entrepreneurship accelerate research commercialization</li>
<li>Unicorn trends: about 1,500 globally and growing; over the past 18 months 50% are AI-first; a wave of “semi-unicorns” in robotics and defense and security</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“At a minimum, there should be several more tens of billions of dollars of venture capital under management.” — <span class="author">Ilya Strebulaev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Хиксвилд became a unicorn in America after all, not in Kazakhstan.” — <span class="author">Ilya Strebulaev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The very best, most interesting solutions will not come to them.” — <span class="author">Ilya Strebulaev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Every month we publish the Unicorn Report.” — <span class="author">Ilya Strebulaev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Fifty percent of all unicorns over the past eighteen months are AI-first.” — <span class="author">Ilya Strebulaev</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Without a large-scale and continuous venture financing ladder, the region will not systematically grow “home” unicorns.</li>
<li>For startups in Kazakhstan, it is more advantageous to build global products from the start, especially in AI and adjacent technological verticals.</li>
<li>The state and corporations need to adopt venture norms: regulator proactivity and properly structured CVCs.</li>
<li>Deep tech growth will require integrating university science with Астана Хаб and encouraging entrepreneurship among professors.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>A target benchmark was formulated: increase the volume of venture capital in Kazakhstan and Central Asia to tens of billions of dollars (including several funds of funds).</li>
<li>Agreed that the “go global from day one” strategy should become the norm for the region’s startups.</li>
<li>Decided to disseminate venture principles among regulators and top management of state corporations (including via the book “Venture Mindset”).</li>
<li>Resolved to promote the creation of CVCs only after training teams in venture norms and building the right mandate and metrics model.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Consolidate LP capital and launch a number of regional funds of funds to bring total VC under management to $10+ billion.</li>
<li>Localize and distribute the Unicorn Investor Report among founders in Kazakhstan/Central Asia as a map of relevant investors by stages and verticals.</li>
<li>Organize a program at Астана Хаб for regulators: regular field sessions with startups/investors (“get outside the four walls”).</li>
<li>Launch a “CVC Academy” for corporations: training in venture norms, forming mandate, KPIs, and processes for interacting with startups.</li>
<li>Implement university policies allowing professors to found startups and serve as their advisors; create interdisciplinary applied laboratories.</li>
<li>Open scouting offices/representative offices in Silicon Valley for CVCs and national companies with quarterly trend reviews for HQ.</li>
<li>Establish grants and services for entering global markets (USA, Japan, Korea) for startups: GTM support, legal and sales support.</li></ul>
