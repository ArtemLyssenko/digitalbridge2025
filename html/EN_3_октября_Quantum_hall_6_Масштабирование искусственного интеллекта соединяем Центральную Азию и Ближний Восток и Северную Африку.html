      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how Central Asian startups can enter MENA markets: from soft-landing and Saudi Arabia's grants to the role of trust and local partnerships. Speakers pointed to the balance between regulation and innovation, highlighting the danger of excessive rules and the importance of early pilots. Priority sectors were identified (smart cities, energy, healthcare, education, manufacturing, fintech) with an emphasis on AI based on access to data. A real case of Xpanse’s multi-market entry was presented and the choice of Uzbekistan as the first destination in Central Asia.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show practical pathways for Central Asian startups to enter GCC/MENA markets</li>
<li>Explain the regulatory environment and soft-landing and grant instruments</li>
<li>Define the roles of partnerships and trust in accelerating scaling</li>
<li>Highlight priority sectors and AI applications over a 5-year horizon</li>
<li>Form a set of steps to prepare for multi-jurisdictional growth</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Where should Central Asian startups start when entering Saudi Arabia and the GCC: registration, fundraising, or partners?</li>
<li>How to balance AI regulation with support for innovation while avoiding excessive restrictions?</li>
<li>Why choose MENA instead of the US/Silicon Valley and which barriers are lower in the region?</li>
<li>Which sectors and types of AI solutions will be most in demand in the region in 3–5 years?</li>
<li>Is Qatar suitable as an entry point for Central Asian startups and what are the market advantages?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>KSA has stepped up support for tech business: NTDP offers soft-landing, grants, salary subsidies, and tax incentives for 1–2 years for new companies.</li>
<li>The danger of excessive AI regulation: rules are needed but should not stifle innovation; the key is joint programs and incentive measures.</li>
<li>Partnerships and trust are a critical factor for entering MENA: local corporations, universities, R&D centers, and government bodies accelerate market access.</li>
<li>In regulated sectors (fintech) licensing takes 18–24 months; a multi-country “parallel” approach reduces missed opportunities.</li>
<li>MENA is currently more tolerant of experiments and early pilots than Europe/the US; capital is available from angels to institutional investors.</li>
<li>Access to data matters more than declaring “we do AI”: build solutions around domain datasets (agri, healthcare, logistics, fintech).</li>
<li>The UAE is attractive as a brand, but the market is smaller; KSA is larger in scale and currently offers strong incentives and a genuine “soft-landing”.</li>
<li>Qatar is a fast-growing and less overheated market with talent attraction programs and R&D support, convenient for pilots.</li>
<li>Jordan is building a sustainable AI base (policy 2020, strategy 2023–2027) and expanding cooperation with Kazakhstan and regional tech parks.</li>
<li>In manufacturing and smart cities, AI will be a driver of efficiency; investment and demand will concentrate in energy, education, and healthcare.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“There are two options: passively stimulate the market with policies or take an active stance with financial packages. Saudi Arabia chose the active one.” — <span class="author">Talal Alhatal</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Instead of casting one fishing rod, cast ten — and see where the bites come faster.” — <span class="author">Saad Ansari</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In the MENA region, tolerance for mistakes and experiments is higher than in Europe and the US.” — <span class="author">Denis Pei</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Entrepreneurship is about connections. Be nomads: travel, learn, and network.” — <span class="author">Yassir El Ismaili</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>MENA markets, especially KSA and Qatar, currently provide a unique window of opportunity for Central Asian startups thanks to active government programs, capital, and readiness for pilots.</li>
<li>Entry success depends on local partnerships and cultural fluency no less than on technology; avoiding excessive regulation is critical for growth.</li>
<li>Priority areas for the next 3–5 years: smart cities and infrastructure, energy (including renewables), healthcare, education, manufacturing, and fintech/BNPL.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Use NTDP soft-landing programs as the standard entry track into Saudi Arabia for Central Asian startups.</li>
<li>Focus MENA market preparation on building local partnerships (corporations, R&D centers, banks, tech parks).</li>
<li>Habitat Association will expand training and mentoring programs on AI regulation and scaling for Central Asian startups.</li>
<li>Define AI priorities for pilots: smart city infrastructure, energy, healthcare, education, and manufacturing.</li>
<li>Confirmed: Xpanse prioritizes Uzbekistan as the first expansion market in Central Asia.</li>
<li>Early multi-licensing in regulated sectors (fintech) is recommended, with parallel preparation of multiple jurisdictions.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Develop a regulatory roadmap for KSA/UAE/Bahrain/Qatar/Jordan (SAMA, CBB, etc.), including data and AI ethics requirements.</li>
<li>Apply for NTDP soft-landing and grant packages; prepare documents to register a legal entity in KSA.</li>
<li>Identify and sign agreements with local partners: banks (BaaS), tech parks (Astana Hub, IT Park Uzbekistan, KHBP), R&D centers.</li>
<li>Launch 2–3 pilot projects in KSA/Qatar in priority sectors, aligning on KPIs and access to domain data.</li>
<li>Organize a team cultural adaptation program (MENA business etiquette, sales cycle, the role of trust and networking).</li>
<li>Start relocating/attracting key specialists through Qatar and KSA talent support programs.</li>
<li>Build secure pipelines for collecting and anonymizing domain data (agri/medical/logistics) to train AI models.</li>
<li>Plan a multi-country strategy: choose a “fast” market for the first license, the rest in parallel (18–24 months).</li></ul>
