      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed the inevitable integration of AI into higher education and the shift from rote memorization to the skill of asking questions. Speakers emphasized the importance of university collaboration with Big Tech and regional cooperation, as well as the shift in the teacher’s role toward mentorship. Ethics and academic integrity were examined separately, along with privacy issues in data analytics and the need to update programs against the backdrop of digital inequality.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Define new models of workforce development using AI as a tool for learning and analytics</li>
<li>Establish systemic partnerships between universities and Big Tech for programs, internships, and joint projects</li>
<li>Preserve and strengthen academic integrity and ethical standards when implementing AI</li>
<li>Reskill instructors into curator-mentors and develop students’ soft skills</li>
<li>Reduce digital inequality and update infrastructure for equal access to AI tools</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Can artificial intelligence replace the instructor, and where is the boundary of acceptable automation?</li>
<li>How to use analytics (video/audio, attendance, learning assessment) without violating rights and privacy?</li>
<li>Which competencies and soft skills are critical for graduates in the era of AI and Big Tech?</li>
<li>How can we speed up curriculum updates so they do not become outdated while preserving academic discipline?</li>
<li>What mechanisms will help stem brain drain and build cooperation among Central Asian universities?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Shift from rote memorization to information seeking and question formulation: AI is becoming an inevitable learning tool, not an adversary.</li>
<li>Universities need active partnerships with Big Tech: companies accumulate competencies and influence skill standards.</li>
<li>Ethics and academic integrity are an unchanging foundation; universities are strengthening proctoring and bringing back written exams.</li>
<li>Privacy dilemma: the use of audio–video analytics in classrooms must take into account the rights of instructors and students.</li>
<li>The instructor’s role is shifting toward mentorship and coaching; emphasis on teamwork, communication, and entrepreneurial thinking.</li>
<li>Digital inequality and infrastructure constraints are especially acute for regional universities; investment and standards are required.</li>
<li>Rapid obsolescence of programs requires regular content modernization and embedding AI modules across all disciplines.</li>
<li>Values and culture as a base: emphasis on character, national values, and the concept of the “well-rounded person” alongside technology.</li>
<li>Regional cooperation (Central Asia) and associations of rectors are a way to scale best practices and share resources.</li>
<li>Government agenda: AI is seen as an element of the country’s digital self-reliance and a strategic priority.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“An era not of rote memorization, but of the ability to find information and ask questions.” — <span class="author">Altair Akhmetov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The problem is not in machines. The problem is in consciousness, in thoughts.” — <span class="author">Asylbek Kozhakhmetov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Academic integrity is the foundation; without it, it is impossible to move forward.” — <span class="author">Asylbek Kozhakhmetov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The instructor must become a curator-mentor.” — <span class="author">Nurzhan Muslimov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The introduction of artificial intelligence technologies is an element of the state's digital self-reliance.” — <span class="author">Altair Akhmetov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI will not replace the educator, but it will change their function: value shifts toward mentorship, ethics, and the development of thinking.</li>
<li>The speed of change requires tight coupling of universities with industry and regional cooperation to share practices and resources.</li>
<li>Without institutional guarantees of academic integrity and data protection, AI implementation will remain contentious.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Agreed to develop university–Big Tech partnerships for joint courses, internships, and AI projects.</li>
<li>Confirmed the priority of academic integrity, including strengthened proctoring and written forms of assessment.</li>
<li>Adopted to repurpose the instructor’s role toward a mentor and coach format, with mandatory upskilling in AI.</li>
<li>Reached an agreement to expand inter-university cooperation in Central Asia through associations of rectors to exchange AI implementation practices.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Conduct an audit of curricula and include basic modules on AI and digital ethics in all fields of study.</li>
<li>Organize upskilling programs for instructors: AI tools, mentorship, assessment in the context of AI.</li>
<li>Develop and approve a privacy and learning analytics (video/audio) policy that respects the rights of all parties.</li>
<li>Create an inter-university working group (based on the association of rectors of Central Asia) to standardize competencies and share AI courses.</li>
<li>Conclude pilot agreements with Big Tech for access to cloud AI services, certifications, and industry cases.</li>
<li>Plan infrastructure leveling: funding for labs, proctoring, and networks for regional universities.</li></ul>
