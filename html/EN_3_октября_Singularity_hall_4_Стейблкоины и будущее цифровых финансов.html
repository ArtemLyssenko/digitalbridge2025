      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel focused on practical stablecoin use cases and Kazakhstan's role as an early driver through a regulatory sandbox and tenge pilots. They discussed key conditions for success: liquidity, distribution, low fees, compliance, and the possible distribution of yield to users. They examined the interaction of stablecoins with CBDC (the digital tenge) and arrived at a complementary role. Infrastructure readiness was noted: cards (Mastercard), QR, wallets, and on/off-ramps for moving from B2B and cross-border payments to retail.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Identify priority stablecoin use cases for Kazakhstan (B2B, cross-border payments, retail via cards and QR).</li>
<li>Form requirements for liquidity, listings, and distribution of local (KZT) stablecoins.</li>
<li>Build a coordinated regulatory framework and licensing of issuers in the National Bank's sandbox.</li>
<li>Reduce user barriers (fees, UX) and provide banking on/off-ramps.</li>
<li>Launch pilots with cards and merchant acquiring for mass adoption.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What are the real stablecoin use cases in the next 12–24 months, and what will be the first driver of mass adoption?</li>
<li>What role do stablecoins play in institutional adoption of crypto, and what barriers hinder their use?</li>
<li>Will CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) compete with stablecoins or complement them?</li>
<li>Why is Solana becoming an attractive infrastructure for stablecoin issuers, and what is the regulatory treatment?</li>
<li>How will competition between local KZT stablecoins and global players (USDT/USDC) evolve given the limited market size?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Kazakhstan is developing a sandbox for stablecoins and preparing separate licensing; the policy toward tenge-denominated stablecoins is supported by the regulator.</li>
<li>The success of a stablecoin is determined by a triad: liquidity and listings; simple buy/sell through banks and low fees; and a clear business incentive (including possible distribution of yield to holders).</li>
<li>B2B and cross-border payments are the nearest workable use cases; retail payments via cards (Mastercard), QR, and wallets are the next stage.</li>
<li>USDT dominates thanks to global liquidity and distribution; local issuers will have to compete through strategic advantages and integration.</li>
<li>Solana attracts issuers with a combination of low costs, high throughput, a broad ecosystem, and features that account for regulatory requirements.</li>
<li>The key user barrier is fees and the complexity of on-chain processes; the task of wallets is to 'hide' the complexity and make the UX as familiar as possible.</li>
<li>CBDCs and private stablecoins are more likely to complement each other; scaling CBDCs encounters infrastructural and user limitations.</li>
<li>For listing pairs on exchanges, volumes and risk management are important (for example, minimum daily turnover and market maker support).</li>
<li>Partnerships with global networks and issuers (Mastercard, Circle) save time and costs, accelerating settlements in USDC.</li>
<li>Local use cases (e.g., pilots in Alatau City) can become measurable testbeds for mass deployment of stablecoins within the country.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“A stablecoin shouldn't share profit only with the issuer—the issuer should share profitability with you.” — <span class="author">Kyrylo Khomyakov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Payments are a social thing, and we already have an interface that lets you use stablecoins as quickly as sending a message to a friend.” — <span class="author">Pavel Khristolyubov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The private market has never lost to the state.” — <span class="author">Gani Uzbekov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Using stablecoins should be as boring as possible—your usual balance in your currency, and what's under the hood is not something the user needs to know.” — <span class="author">Pavel Khristolyubov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Mass adoption of stablecoins in Kazakhstan is more likely to start with B2B and cross-border settlements, then move into retail via cards and QR.</li>
<li>Regulatory clarity, liquidity, and distribution are the key to the success of local KZT stablecoins in competing with global issuances.</li>
<li>CBDCs and private stablecoins will coexist, but in the short term it is private stablecoins that are showing more practical use cases.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Focus local stablecoin pilots on B2B and cross-border settlements, with a phased rollout into retail payments.</li>
<li>Develop liquidity and distribution requirements for listing KZT stablecoins on exchanges (including minimum turnover and market-making).</li>
<li>Expand on/off-ramps and card solutions: the launch of non-custodial cards with top-ups in USDC (via Mastercard) has been announced.</li>
<li>Continue work in the National Bank's regulatory sandbox and prepare proposals for licensing stablecoin issuers.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>For the regulator: prepare a draft of licensing and supervision rules for stablecoin issuers (including reserve and reporting requirements).</li>
<li>For exchanges and issuers: create market-making programs and target liquidity thresholds for pairs with KZT stablecoins.</li>
<li>For banks and fintechs: deploy convenient on/off-ramps, integrate stablecoin payments with the national QR and cards.</li>
<li>For wallets: hide on-chain complexity and optimize fees, delivering a UX 'like a messenger payment'.</li>
<li>For the industry: launch pilots in merchant environments (Alatau City/Astana) with measurable KPIs for volume and payment recurrence.</li>
<li>For issuers: test models for distributing yield to holders to incentivize retention and usage.</li></ul>
