      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel focused on the launch of KVG’s fund of funds with a $1 billion target as a catalyst for innovation in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. It discussed the late-stage capital gap and KIC’s response via a new fund, governance and transparency standards (ILPA, МФЦА) to attract private and institutional capital. Attention was paid to the role of family offices and regulatory changes enabling allocations to alternatives, as well as bridges to global markets through side-letter strategies and programs for entry into the US.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Catalyze innovation in Kazakhstan and Central Asia by launching a fund of funds with a $1 billion target size</li>
<li>Close the funding gap at bridge/Series A–B stages and increase the volume of late rounds</li>
<li>Attract and crowd in private and institutional capital while maintaining high corporate governance standards</li>
<li>Develop strong local GPs and expand the role of corporate venture funds</li>
<li>Ensure startups from the region access global markets through partnerships and terms for international funds</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How does the Generative Nation concept translate into practice through a fund of funds, and what will be the priority focus?</li>
<li>How will KVG’s mandate (local focus at first close and 70/30 as it scales) affect the share of foreign investment in the region?</li>
<li>What mechanisms and governance standards will accelerate time to money without compromising selection quality?</li>
<li>What role will KIC play in eliminating the late-round gap and through which instruments?</li>
<li>What regulatory and market measures will bring family offices and corporations into venture funds and CVC?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>KVG targets $1 billion; current commitments exceed $100 million (including $30 million from KIC); initial focus on Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, with a gradual shift to a 70/30 model upon reaching $400–500 million</li>
<li>KVG invests only through funds and requires licensed GPs (МФЦА/AIFC or other jurisdictions) with a mandate for the region; enhanced corporate governance per ILPA 3.0 and a board with 2/3 independent members and no representatives of government bodies</li>
<li>The region shows a skew toward Pre-Seed/Seed (~60% of deals) and a capital shortage in bridge/Series A–B rounds (<1%); time to money of 2–3 months remains long</li>
<li>KIC plans to launch its own venture fund managed by an in-house GP (B Global Ventures) of up to $30 million with $1–2 million checks to close the bridge/Series A–B gap; target co-fundraising: at least 50% private capital</li>
<li>The market needs a steady inflow of about $100 million per year into venture; without it, promising companies (e.g., ChocoFamily) are forced to sell due to the absence of large rounds</li>
<li>Priority is to grow local GPs: manager training programs are needed (like Emergence GP/EBRD), rather than betting on third-tier foreign GPs</li>
<li>Family offices do not expect state guarantees; they need reliable legal infrastructure (МФЦА), protection of investor rights, and regulatory changes to allow allocations to alternatives (e.g., 5–6% for insurers and asset managers without inflated reserves)</li>
<li>CVCs are critical for giving startups access to conservative industries: large and quasi-state companies are encouraged to open pilots, accelerators, and measure effectiveness through clear KPIs</li>
<li>For globalization: build companies for large markets (USA) from the outset; use side letters when investing in international funds so they consider founders from Kazakhstan and the region; avoid excessive geographic isolation of mandates</li>
<li>KVG emphasizes transparency and regular communication with the ecosystem (Astana/Almaty and regional delegations) to adapt practices to market needs</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We do not invest in startups directly.” — <span class="author">Askar Bilisbekov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Two-thirds of our board are independent directors, including the chair; no representatives of government bodies.” — <span class="author">Askar Bilisbekov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The market lacks roughly one hundred million dollars a year, and we need it like air.” — <span class="author">Murat Abdrakhmanov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The previous experience with direct state investments is one hundred percent disastrous — let’s not repeat the same mistake.” — <span class="author">Murat Abdrakhmanov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The issue of guarantees for family offices doesn’t arise at all: we need quality infrastructure and protection of investor rights.” — <span class="author">Chingiz Zhaksybek</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The most successful startups are those that build for a big market from the start, not for a local ceiling.” — <span class="author">Aset Abdualiev</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>A fund of funds with strong governance and transparency can pool private capital and close systemic gaps at late stages.</li>
<li>Alongside capital, the market needs local professional GPs and an active role for CVCs to scale products and pilots.</li>
<li>Globalizing startups via the USA and side-letter strategies with international funds increases the chances of large exits without overheating the local market.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>KVG maintains a privately oriented capital structure and implements ILPA 3.0 standards with 2/3 independent directors and no representatives of government bodies.</li>
<li>KVG’s first close focuses on Kazakhstan and the Central Asia/Caucasus region; transition to 70/30 (international investments) as AUM grows to $400–500 million.</li>
<li>KIC is launching a venture fund managed by B Global Ventures (target up to $30 million) with $1–2 million checks for bridge/Series A–B and a requirement to attract ~50% private capital.</li>
<li>When investing in global funds, the practice of side letters will be used, obliging them to pay attention to startups with roots in Kazakhstan/Central Asia.</li>
<li>Regular open meetings of KVG with the community and partners in Astana/Almaty and across the region are established as an ongoing transparency format.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>KVG: accelerate fundraising to the next threshold ($400–500 million), finalize the composition of the independent board, and onboard GPs licensed by МФЦА/other jurisdictions.</li>
<li>KIC: launch B Global Ventures (registration, mandate, investment committee), form a pipeline of bridge/Series A–B deals and co-investments with local GPs.</li>
<li>Regulators and the National Bank: prepare amendments to normative legal acts to permit 5–6% allocations to alternative assets for insurers/asset managers/brokers without excessive reserves.</li>
<li>Ecosystem: design and fund a local GP training program (together with EBRD/the Emergence GP approach) and launch small funds to build a track record.</li>
<li>Large corporations and the quasi-state sector: open CVC/venture accelerators and corporate pilots with clear KPIs and access for local startups.</li>
<li>International expansion: via Silk Road Innovation Hub, build a channel to Silicon Valley (mentorship, syndicates, introductions to funds) and a stack of side letters with global GPs.</li></ul>
