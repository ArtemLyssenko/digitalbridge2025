      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed why AI is not hype but an infrastructural technology, and how investors evaluate early AI teams primarily by the qualities of the founders. The speakers examined the risks of “add-ons over LLMs” and the importance of competitive advantages through proprietary data and IP. Central Asia is recognized as a promising hub with a strong engineering base, but startups need a global focus and English. The role of Kazakhstan’s Fund of Funds and “smart money” in moving from seed to scaling stages was considered separately.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Understand why AI now and how it transforms industries rather than being a short-term trend</li>
<li>Define key criteria for investors to assess early AI startups</li>
<li>Discuss the risks of dependence on Big Tech and ways to build defensibility (data, IP, niche focus)</li>
<li>Identify paths for Central Asian startups to global scaling and the role of the Fund of Funds</li>
<li>Formulate what value smart investors should bring beyond capital</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Why AI, and why now for startups and investors?</li>
<li>What do venture funds look at when selecting early-stage AI startups?</li>
<li>How to reduce the risk that Big Tech/LLM updates will “kill” a product built on top of an API?</li>
<li>Which sectors and models are most promising for Central Asia to enter global markets?</li>
<li>How will Kazakhstan’s Fund of Funds affect the maturity and global reach of the regional ecosystem?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI is a foundational technology on the level of “electricity”: the value lies in applied deployments across verticals, not in the LLM itself.</li>
<li>Early-stage investment decisions are made around the founder: persistence, breadth of vision, willingness to pivot, and strategic thinking.</li>
<li>An AI product’s defensibility is created by proprietary data, methodologies, IP, and domain depth; the LLM is only a technological layer.</li>
<li>Platform dependency risks on OpenAI/Big Tech are offset by an agnostic stack and emphasis on unique datasets.</li>
<li>A portfolio approach hedges part of the technology risk; additionally, assess solution replicability and barriers to entry.</li>
<li>Example of niche depth: AI “patient” simulators for medical schools with thousands of scenarios—high copying barriers and local protocols.</li>
<li>Central Asia has a strong engineering base; the strategy is to keep R&D local, sell globally, with HQ in friendly jurisdictions.</li>
<li>“Smart money” means synergy, intros, and help with scaling; founders should choose investors as carefully as investors choose them.</li>
<li>A Fund of Funds can close the late-stage gap and build a bridge for follow-on rounds, but the early stage requires entrepreneurial boldness.</li>
<li>Scaling is preceded by PMF: in the early phase spend more time on customers and revenue, less on endless fundraising.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Don’t look at venture capitalists as gods—treat them as strategic partners.” — <span class="author">Zhan Karsybayev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Early-stage startups spend too much time trying to raise money from investors, while they should be trying to raise money from customers.” — <span class="author">Robbert Abbanat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI is like electricity: a technology that will enable everything else to be done.” — <span class="author">Mirat Akhmetsadykov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“You need to be bolder: sell locally, but go to global markets right away and add English.” — <span class="author">Yagiz Karadeniz</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“If someone in Kazakhstan says there is no money, that’s not an entrepreneur; an entrepreneur’s task is to find a path and convince the investor.” — <span class="author">Mirat Akhmetsadykov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI projects win not thanks to the LLM itself, but due to unique data, methodologies, and deep domain expertise that create defensibility.</li>
<li>The region needs a global mindset: English as the standard, early validation in external markets, and choosing investors with real added value.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan’s Fund of Funds can improve access to capital at later stages and build a relay of rounds given PMF and traction.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Focus on investing in founders with high resilience and readiness to pivot, not on AI “hype.”</li>
<li>Evaluate and support AI startups with clear defensibility through proprietary data and IP, as well as technological agnosticism.</li>
<li>Build bridges between early funds and larger investors (including the Fund of Funds) for follow-on scaling rounds.</li>
<li>Systematically promote a global-first approach among Central Asian startups (English, overseas sales from an early stage).</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>For startups: validate PMF through paying customers before active scaling and large rounds.</li>
<li>Develop a defensibility strategy: collect/create proprietary datasets, formalize IP and domain methodologies.</li>
<li>Build a technology stack agnostic to specific LLMs/APIs to reduce platform risk.</li>
<li>Move communications and materials into English and start targeted sales in the EU/USA via LinkedIn/direct outreach campaigns.</li>
<li>For early-stage investors: establish co-investor relationships with larger funds/the Fund of Funds for pre-agreed bridges to Series A+.</li>
<li>For founders: deliberately choose “smart investors” with relevant intros and GTM support; run references with portfolio companies.</li>
<li>For the ecosystem: promote mental and psychological support programs for founders to reduce the “fear of globalization.”</li></ul>
