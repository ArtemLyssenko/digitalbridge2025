      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The speaker presented a human-centered integrated AI-enabled HR platform covering the journey from hiring to learning and performance evaluation. The key principle: first define competencies and gaps, then build an individual development plan, and only after that bring in coaching. AI agents automate competency identification, assessment, and learning personalization, while coaching is delivered by live coaches (450–500 in the Glo Coach network). A case of the LANCE AI agent was shown for talent assessment and competency-based interviewing as an alternative to expensive and inaccurate questionnaires and 360s, although the live demo fell through due to internet problems.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show how AI reimagines HR processes from hiring to employee development</li>
<li>Formulate the methodology: competencies → gap assessment → individualized development plan → coaching</li>
<li>Introduce the LANCE AI agent for talent assessment and competency-based interviewing</li>
<li>Address market demand for using AI in hiring while accounting for the role of human intuition</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to implement AI in HR not to replace people but to augment them?</li>
<li>How to correctly define and measure key role-based competencies and identify gaps?</li>
<li>How to improve the quality and speed of hiring and 360 assessments while preserving the role of human intuition?</li>
<li>Can AI replace a professional coach, and where is the boundary of its application?</li>
<li>How to build a long-term path of development and habit formation for employees?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI will not replace people, but people who use AI will replace those who do not</li>
<li>An integrated platform should start with a competency model, then gap assessment, development plan, and only then coaching/career</li>
<li>At Glo Coach, coaching is delivered by live coaches (450–500), and AI serves as a tool to increase their effectiveness</li>
<li>Development is a continuous, long-term process focused on forming personal habits</li>
<li>AI agents help: identify competencies, run assessments, create personalized development plans</li>
<li>LANCE is an AI consultant for talent assessment and conducting competency-based/behavioral interviews</li>
<li>Classic questionnaires (MBTI, DISC, Hogan) and traditional 360 often provide limited and generalized feedback</li>
<li>Behavioral interviews provide more concrete data but are costly and resource-intensive—LANCE can scale and reduce the cost of the process</li>
<li>The technical demonstration fell through due to lack of internet; an offline demo was offered after the session</li>
<li>AI is especially useful in high-volume hiring contexts, helping to structure selection and make it more objective</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Artificial intelligence should not replace people, but people who use AI will replace those who do not use AI.” — <span class="author">Robert Ferguson Abbanat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“If you skip the first three steps and go straight to coaching, you'll just waste time and money.” — <span class="author">Robert Ferguson Abbanat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“LANCE is the first AI consultant: it performs talent assessment.” — <span class="author">Robert Ferguson Abbanat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The problem is that the [360 assessment] process itself is awful.” — <span class="author">Robert Ferguson Abbanat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“When I read such a report, it feels like I'm reading my horoscope.” — <span class="author">Robert Ferguson Abbanat</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The greatest impact of AI in HR is achieved through a competency-based approach and personalized development, not by replacing coaches with algorithms.</li>
<li>AI agents can significantly improve the objectivity and scalability of talent assessment and interviews, reducing cost and increasing speed while preserving the key role of humans.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Adopted the platform workflow: competencies → gap assessment → personal development plan → coaching/career growth.</li>
<li>Decided to keep coaching with live coaches, using AI as a support and scaling tool.</li>
<li>Decided to offer session participants an offline demonstration of the LANCE AI agent after resolving the technical issues.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Create/refine the competency model for key roles in the organization.</li>
<li>Launch a pilot with the LANCE AI agent for talent assessment and behavioral interviews in one or two hiring streams.</li>
<li>Set up feedback collection and verification, reducing reliance on questionnaire ratings and traditional 360.</li>
<li>Train HR and coaches to use AI tools and integrate them into current development processes.</li>
<li>Develop individual development plans and a habit-formation program for pilot teams.</li>
<li>Organize a separate session for a live LANCE demo and stakeholder Q&A.</li></ul>
