      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel focused on the practical path into Y Combinator: from the application and the tough 10-minute interview to repeat submissions and the role of traction. The speakers shared different trajectories — from biotech and developer tools to AI call centers — and sales/validation tactics (personal installs, early payments). They discussed networking (warm intros, cold messages), fundraising, and the specifics of YC partners. The session ended with a Q&A and an agreement to have a short networking meetup at the Eurasian Hub booth.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show real scenarios of getting into Y Combinator and passing the interview</li>
<li>Provide practical tips on the application, validation, and building traction</li>
<li>Give the audience an understanding of how to build sales and product in parallel</li>
<li>Highlight the role of networking and referrals for applying and fundraising</li>
<li>Connect participants with founders for follow-up consultations</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What are the key success factors in a startup and what does YC look for in a team?</li>
<li>How best to show the uniqueness of the project in the YC application and how to substantiate it?</li>
<li>How to build networking effectively and get feedback on the application from YC alumni?</li>
<li>What to focus on first: product or sales to customers?</li>
<li>How to compete with strong teams in the market (for example, Cursor) and how to differentiate?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The YC application must be exceptionally clear and concise; long answers are a red flag that you don’t understand your business.</li>
<li>The YC interview is 10 minutes of tough, rapid questions; they test the depth of understanding of the problem, customer, and plan.</li>
<li>Repeat submissions are normal: traction and progress between applications significantly increase your chances.</li>
<li>Validation through paying customers even for small amounts (e.g., $100–$200) is better than any LOIs.</li>
<li>Active offline sales (“Colllison install”): go to offices, install the product, gather instant feedback.</li>
<li>A network is built with a mix of warm intros and cold messages; persistent selling of yourself and the product matters.</li>
<li>Biotech requires large budgets and experiments; sometimes it’s more strategic to start with software and services for revenue.</li>
<li>YC partners vary in style (strict and friendly); prepare for each interview precisely, with numbers and a demo.</li>
<li>Location and relocation: YC expects full engagement and readiness to work from San Francisco during the batch.</li>
<li>The Kazakhstani ecosystem at YC is growing: there have already been six startups, four are represented on the panel.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“If you get rejected — just keep working. As soon as you have traction, they will definitely take you.” — <span class="author">Arkady Telegin</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“I went to more than a hundred offices and installed the product myself — that’s the best way to get honest feedback.” — <span class="author">Arlan Rakhmetzhanov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In biology, compared to other fields, you need a lot of funding.” — <span class="author">Nurlybek Mursaliev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In the entire history of Y Combinator, there have been six Kazakhstani startups; you see four of them today.” — <span class="author">Nurdaulet Bazylbekov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>YC values clarity of thought, proven demand, and the willingness to iterate quickly; formal signs of a “beautiful” application are secondary.</li>
<li>Traction and real customers outweigh words and LOIs; even a small payment is a meaningful signal.</li>
<li>A strong network and bold direct actions (offline installs, cold messages) accelerate sales and your chances at YC.</li>
<li>For capital-intensive industries, it’s strategic to combine R&D with software/services to grow revenue and investor trust.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>A short Q&A format with the audience was adopted.</li>
<li>Agreed to meet for networking and brief consultations at the Eurasian Hub booth after the panel.</li>
<li>Speakers agreed to share contacts and accept applications/questions from those wishing to apply to YC.</li>
<li>Confirmed that the discussion will focus on practical steps for applying to YC (application, interview, traction).</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Participants: prepare a concise and clear YC application; remove jargon and leave only facts and metrics.</li>
<li>Prepare a demo and practice the 10-minute interview with mock sessions, including tough questions about the market and customers.</li>
<li>Find your first paying customers (even for small amounts) and record retention/value metrics.</li>
<li>Activate your network: ask for warm intros to YC alumni and partners; in parallel, do high-quality cold outreach.</li>
<li>Organizers/speakers: compile and send a list of useful materials about YC (essays, videos, checklists).</li>
<li>Founders: conduct “offline installs” at target customers for accelerated feedback and adoption.</li>
<li>Teams in capital-intensive fields: think through a software component/services for early revenue and investor de-risking.</li></ul>
