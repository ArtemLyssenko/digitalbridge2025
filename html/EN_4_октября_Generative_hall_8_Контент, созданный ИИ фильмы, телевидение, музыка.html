      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed whether AI is a co-author or a tool, and how it is changing the production of film, TV, and music. Speakers agreed that AI democratizes entry into the industry and strengthens post- and marketing processes, while final creative decisions remain with humans. Special focus was placed on Kazakhstan’s opportunities: rapid regulation, cultural datasets, and infrastructure can make the country a regional AI hub. The discussion covered the impact of short formats and social media, legal and ethical risks, as well as infrastructure requirements (5G, GPU/NPU) and development horizons (3D, immersive AI, hologram artists).</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Articulate the role of AI in film, TV, and music production: co-author vs tool</li>
<li>Define priorities for Kazakhstan’s ecosystem (law, data culture, infrastructure) to scale AI content</li>
<li>Assess the impact of social networks and short formats on promotion and monetization of content</li>
<li>Identify key legal and ethical challenges (copyright, labeling, fair compensation)</li>
<li>Outline technological directions for 2–10 years (3D generation, interactive TV, real-time generation)</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Is AI our co-creator or just a tool in the workflow?</li>
<li>When will truly original AI content appear, rather than a recombination of training data?</li>
<li>How do geography and cultural specifics affect model training and the adoption of AI in production?</li>
<li>Are networks and compute (5G, GPU/NPU) ready for streaming and real-time AI generation?</li>
<li>How are TikTok/Instagram/VK platforms evolving, and what is the role of short formats for AI content?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Democratization: AI lowers the barrier to entry, allowing creators without expensive equipment to showcase their vision and prototype.</li>
<li>In film, AI is strongest in script work and post-production; the director’s role as the final decision-maker remains human.</li>
<li>Music: AI has become an essential tool for promo and production; music videos yield to the effectiveness of multiple short clips/reels.</li>
<li>The “AI-generated” label is gradually losing meaning for audiences: content is perceived as entertainment regardless of how it was created.</li>
<li>Geography matters for cultural relevance: local teams and datasets are needed (language, taboos, instruments, voices).</li>
<li>Kazakhstan has a window of opportunity: swift regulation, legal protection for authors, registries of voices and instruments, training of lawyers.</li>
<li>Legal risks will intensify: major labels and studios will litigate over rights, as has already happened in the digital era.</li>
<li>Infrastructure is a critical factor for real-time AI: 5G/network, local GPU/NPU, and enabling policies.</li>
<li>Near future: growth of 3D generation and immersive/interactive AI (including TV), the emergence of hologram artists and AI performers.</li>
<li>As AI technologies are released faster, the human idea and creative will become the main differentiator and source of trust.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“If we tell the truth about AI, it’s not just a tool, it’s a choice… and it really is a co-author.” — <span class="author">Frensis Teo</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“A director is a person who says “yes” or “no” all day; the will to make the final decisions remains human.” — <span class="author">Aisultan Seitov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI has become a must-have tool for those who want to stay relevant in the music industry.” — <span class="author">Olzhas Baimagambetov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“To keep up in this race, you need to chase not the technologies, but the development of your creative potential.” — <span class="author">Aizatulla Khusein</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“It is important for Kazakhstan to create a legal framework that will protect creators and rightsholders in the AI era.” — <span class="author">David Jank</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI has already become an integral element of production and promo, augmenting creators and accelerating production, but final creative responsibility remains with the human.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan can quickly take the position of the region’s AI hub provided clear rules on copyright, cultural datasets, and infrastructure development are created.</li>
<li>Short formats and social platforms are becoming the main distribution funnel, and the boundaries between AI and non-AI content are blurring for the consumer.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Recognize AI as a creator’s companion in a range of tasks (variability, post-production, marketing) while keeping the final choice with the human.</li>
<li>Support the development in Kazakhstan of a specialized legal framework for AI content and protection of creators’ copyrights.</li>
<li>Focus pilot projects on short formats and AI-friendly platforms for quick impact and demand validation.</li>
<li>Initiate the creation of local cultural datasets and registries of voices/instruments for proper model training.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Prepare a package of proposals on AI regulation (copyright, licensing, fair use) for the relevant ministries of the Republic of Kazakhstan.</li>
<li>Launch a cross-industry working group on infrastructure (5G, data centers with GPUs, edge NPUs) to support real-time AI.</li>
<li>Organize training programs for creators and lawyers: generative pipelines, rights clearance, ethics and labeling.</li>
<li>Pilot interactive AI formats for TV/OTT (immersive shows, real-time viewer co-creation).</li>
<li>Roll out an initiative to collect and legally license local audio and video datasets (languages, timbres, instruments).</li></ul>
