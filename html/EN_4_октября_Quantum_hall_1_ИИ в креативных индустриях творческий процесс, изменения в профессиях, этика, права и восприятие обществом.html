      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed the rapid integration of AI into Kazakhstan’s creative industries, from ideation to production and effectiveness evaluation. Key barriers were highlighted: regulatory uncertainty, a shortage of local datasets and cultural-linguistic nuances, as well as risks of loss of context and ethical challenges. Practices for cost reduction and content scaling using AI tools and mixed creative stacks were presented. Consensus: prioritize education, local models, and ethics/brand safety standards while preserving the uniqueness of human creativity.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Assess the impact of AI on the creative industries globally and in Kazakhstan</li>
<li>Identify key obstacles: legal, ethical, linguistic, and educational</li>
<li>Discuss effective tools and cases of AI implementation in production and marketing</li>
<li>Formulate approaches to rights, authorship, and brand safety in the AI era</li>
<li>Outline joint steps with industry and the government (МинИи) to develop the local AI ecosystem</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How is AI changing the creative process and production chains in Kazakhstan and the region?</li>
<li>What are the main barriers to adoption (legislation, rights, ethics, data, education)?</li>
<li>How can authenticity and cultural code be preserved when scaling creativity with AI?</li>
<li>Who owns the rights to AI content, and how to manage the risks of deepfakes and fraud?</li>
<li>Which practices genuinely increase efficiency (CTR, CPL) and reduce costs in performance marketing?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Kazakhstan shows a high volume of video content creation; AI is already embedded at all stages of production (idea—script—video—evaluation).</li>
<li>Practical tools (TikTok Symphony, CapCut, AI avatars) accelerate production, enable content localization into dozens of languages, and forecast metrics.</li>
<li>A shortage of local datasets and the Western cultural bias of leading LLMs limit relevance for the Kazakh language and regional contexts.</li>
<li>Legal questions of authorship of AI content and brand safety remain unresolved; the risks of deepfakes and fraud are increasing.</li>
<li>Education and accelerated retraining (from early school to project managers) are critical for conscious and safe use of AI.</li>
<li>Implementing AI cuts production costs by 25–35% and increases campaign performance by ~30–40% with a mixed creative portfolio (UGC + pro + AI).</li>
<li>Concern: 'loss of context' and weakened transfer of expertise to junior staff with excessive reliance on assistants.</li>
<li>Need for transparency in budgeting and accounting: AI can become a mechanism for control and analytics of fund allocation.</li>
<li>A new market of roles: AI assistant managers, AI creators, curators of cultural-linguistic quality; at the same time, the uniqueness of human creativity is a key asset.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“AI has penetrated all stages: from the moment an idea is created to writing texts, creating videos, and evaluating effectiveness.” — <span class="author">Yulia Kushnir</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI is like Excel in its day: a stunning tool and, importantly, not a bad conversationalist.” — <span class="author">Anton Kim</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We have a scarcity of datasets and a Western cultural bias in the models; we need to develop our own neural networks — I’m betting on KAZ LLM.” — <span class="author">Dmitry Sinitsa</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Creativity is a deeply human quality. Artificial intelligence is just a tool, like a hammer.” — <span class="author">Aika Alemi</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“This is, again, about our values; perhaps we should return to Abai’s 'Words of Edification'.” — <span class="author">Sholpan Makhmudova</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI has become a systemic tool for the creative industries, but without local data, ethics, and education its effect will be limited and risky.</li>
<li>A 'human + AI' strategy, grounded in cultural code, transparent financing, and legal certainty, ensures growth in content quality and effectiveness.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Focus on creating and enriching local datasets (Kazakh and regional languages) and supporting KAZ LLM.</li>
<li>Launch AI education programs for creative specialists and managers (tools, ethics, rights, brand safety).</li>
<li>Establish industry standards for checking cultural-linguistic quality (accent, stress, local norms) for AI content.</li>
<li>Initiate a working group with the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence on authorship, deepfakes, and the regulation of AI in advertising/media.</li>
<li>Recommend a mixed creative portfolio (UGC + professional production + AI) to optimize costs and improve performance.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Compile a registry of AI tools for the creative industries (TikTok Symphony, CapCut, Notion AI, etc.) and run a series of practical workshops.</li>
<li>Launch pilots on localization and auto-dubbing with audits by native speakers and brand safety checklists.</li>
<li>Organize collection and labeling of local data (text, audio, visual) to further train models on culturally relevant examples.</li>
<li>Prepare guidelines on copyright and AI ethics, including procedures for responding to deepfakes.</li>
<li>Conduct A/B tests of AI creatives versus classic and UGC, tracking effects on CTR/CVR/CPL and costs.</li>
<li>Implement AI analytics in budgeting and project control processes (transparency of fund allocation).</li>
<li>Develop a mentorship program for young creatives to reduce the risk of 'loss of context' when working with AI assistants.</li>
<li>Communicate cultural code and art history in training creators, integrating local references into prompt engineering.</li></ul>
