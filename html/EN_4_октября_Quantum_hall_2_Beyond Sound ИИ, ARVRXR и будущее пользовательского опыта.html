      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how AI accelerates development and changes UX in VR/AR/XR and games, while the experience remains constrained by platforms. The central theme was the boundaries of authorship and machine co-authorship: AI as a tool and as a collaborator. They examined cultural and ethical challenges—the need for local datasets, labeling of bots, and preserving collective experience amid personalization. Forecasts for the next 5–10 years were voiced: growth of interactive and empathic environments, institutional legitimation of digital art, and a priority on self-education.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Understand how AI transforms user experience in AR/VR/XR and gaming</li>
<li>Define the boundaries of authorship and the artist's control when working with generative tools</li>
<li>Identify cultural and ethical risks in AI- and virtual environments</li>
<li>Discuss the role of institutions (museums, galleries, universities) in legitimizing and implementing digital art</li>
<li>Formulate adaptation practices: local datasets, personalization without loss of collective experience, and educational approaches</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How is AI changing the user experience in VR/AR/XR and the game industry?</li>
<li>Where is the boundary of authorship and the artist's control when working with AI?</li>
<li>How does AI support the development of personalized scenarios and learning environments in games?</li>
<li>What ethical and cultural challenges arise in AI-based virtual worlds?</li>
<li>What will the future of AI combined with AR/VR/XR look like over a 5–10 year horizon?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI accelerates iterations and prototyping and improves development quality, but UX is still limited by platform capabilities (platform bottleneck).</li>
<li>In art, AI turns passive viewing into an interactive experience (chatbots, quests, generative works), strengthening the link between the physical and the digital.</li>
<li>Authorship is a spectrum: from tool to collaborator; training models on your own data and maintaining control over the narrative and language helps preserve style.</li>
<li>Media complexity affects AI's role: in 'simple' media the sense of presence is valuable, in 'complex' ones (games) greater automation of code, dialogues, and assets is acceptable.</li>
<li>AI adoption faces a psychological barrier: creators often return to familiar tools so as not to lose a sense of control.</li>
<li>Cultural relevance of data is critical: Taiwan's example with 21 LLMs for 21 languages; for Kazakhstan it is important to account for the multilingual context.</li>
<li>We need to preserve collective experience amid personalization and explicitly label where it's a human and where it's a bot to avoid role confusion.</li>
<li>LLMs are not only a tool but also a new medium; specialized 'creative' models are still rare and remain underground.</li>
<li>Institutions and markets must legitimize digital art: integrating digital practices into museums/galleries and developing new forms of distribution (including games).</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“I see AI not as a tool but as a collaborator—a facilitator of the process.” — <span class="author">Kristina Khara</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In AI cinema, it's important to write the script based on an understanding of the tool's capabilities—you can't just jump in 'from scratch'.” — <span class="author">Yuldus Bakhtiozina</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Work with AI as an artistic material—like wood or metal.” — <span class="author">Hugo du Plessis</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“For me, Instagram died with the arrival of Reels.” — <span class="author">Aleksandr Mezin</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We must humanize technology, otherwise only commercial clichés will remain.” — <span class="author">Almagul Menlibayeva</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI expands creative and UX capabilities but requires mindful control of authorship and narrative.</li>
<li>Local and culturally relevant datasets are key to high-quality and ethical content in a multilingual environment.</li>
<li>LLMs form a new medium while reinforcing existing ones; ideas and experience matter more than the toolset.</li>
<li>The legitimation of digital art depends on the active role of museums, galleries, and educational practices, as well as on mass self-education.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Focus museum and gallery programs on integrating interactive and AI-assisted practices.</li>
<li>Promote the use of locally relevant datasets and language models for the Kazakhstani context.</li>
<li>Formulate transparency principles: explicit labeling of 'human/bot' interactions in artistic and educational projects.</li>
<li>Support self-education and knowledge-sharing practices (open tutorials, workshops) as the primary mechanism of adaptation.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Develop prototypes of personalized museum chatbots and run pilot showcases with visitor feedback.</li>
<li>Collect and curate local datasets (Kazakh, Russian, etc.) for text and multimodal models relevant to the cultural context.</li>
<li>Prepare methodological materials for artists: a guide on authorship, quality control, and ethics when working with AI.</li>
<li>Organize a series of workshops on creating interactive XR experiences with AI (dialogues, multi-agent characters, asset generation).</li>
<li>Implement a transparency policy: label bots and automated content in exhibition and educational environments.</li>
<li>Create a practitioner community (lab/club) at KBTU and partner institutions for exchanging developments and expertise.</li></ul>
