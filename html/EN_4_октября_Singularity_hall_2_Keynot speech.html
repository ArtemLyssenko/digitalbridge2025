      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>Three keynotes linked the talent shortage and rapid skill obsolescence to the need for a human-centered design of human–AI symbiosis. A trust framework was proposed along with rethinking the measurement of “intangible” human qualities to drive productivity growth in the cognitive economy. AI and data science practices for climate adaptation were showcased: integrating heterogeneous data, digital twins, and local solutions. Kazakhstan was noted as a jurisdiction with high potential for AI leadership thanks to its young population, government support, and the Alem AI initiative.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Formulate a human-centered approach to using AI to increase productivity while preserving human autonomy.</li>
<li>Identify priority skills of the future and mechanisms for continuous reskilling to overcome talent shortages and obsolescence.</li>
<li>Build AI trust and governance frameworks (authority, reliability, accountability, transparency) in organizations and at the policy level.</li>
<li>Show how AI and data fusion help in climate adaptation: from air quality maps to infrastructure digital twins.</li>
<li>Launch cooperation among business, government, and universities for locally relevant solutions (using Kazakhstan as an example).</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How can we bridge the gap between the shortage of IT talent and simultaneously rising unemployment due to skill obsolescence?</li>
<li>Which uniquely human skills (empathy, systems thinking, leadership) should become the core of education and management in the AI era?</li>
<li>How do we design a trusted human–AI symbiosis that augments rather than replaces human autonomy?</li>
<li>How can we measure and capitalize on “intangible” human qualities (inspiration, empathy, love) in management and financial systems?</li>
<li>How can we collect, verify, and integrate heterogeneous data (satellites, sensors, local sources) to make climate decisions at the city level?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The IT market simultaneously faces a talent shortage and unemployment due to accelerated competency obsolescence; learning must anticipate the needs of tomorrow.</li>
<li>AI shifts value toward human qualities: creativity, empathy, interaction, creating new things, and social intelligence.</li>
<li>The transition to a cognitive economy requires human–AI symbiosis and deliberate interface design that preserves human autonomy.</li>
<li>Trust is key to productivity: authority, reliability, accountability, and transparency must outweigh purely profit-driven motives.</li>
<li>There are no “safe” professions where AI is inapplicable: all roles will shift toward human-oriented tasks and working with AI as an engine.</li>
<li>Integrating heterogeneous data (satellites, monitors, wearables) and modeling (including LLMs and digital twins) allows us to close gaps in climate indicators and risks.</li>
<li>Use cases: global air quality mapping with LLM data fusion; electricity demand forecasting without full monitoring; a city planning tool for heat resilience; a digital twin for cascading infrastructure risks.</li>
<li>Measuring human qualities (empathy, inspiration) is not yet embedded in financial standards, but is critical for productivity and leadership.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan stands out for its young, dynamic population and government support (Alem AI initiative), creating an opportunity for AI leadership.</li>
<li>Success of AI in climate and productivity requires local partnerships and contextual adaptation of solutions rather than one-size-fits-all models.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We must focus more on human capabilities so that with AI we become more human.” — <span class="author">Nikolya Sadirak</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Kazakhstan can become one of the leaders in artificial intelligence around the world.” — <span class="author">Nikolya Sadirak</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“I see the future of artificial intelligence as a symbiosis of human and machine.” — <span class="author">Olaf J. Grot</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“At the heart of digital transformation is the human being.” — <span class="author">Olaf J. Grot</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“If we do not understand this situation, how can we possibly solve these problems at all?” — <span class="author">Gevin Sheddik</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“There is no point in me sitting in Cardiff, developing AI models and just hoping they will work in Astana.” — <span class="author">Gevin Sheddik</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>A human-centered human–AI symbiosis is the most viable path for growth in productivity and employment.</li>
<li>Trust and ethical AI governance must be embedded in organizational strategies and public policy.</li>
<li>Integration of multichannel data and digital twins already provides practical tools for climate adaptation at the level of cities and infrastructure.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan has the conditions for accelerated AI leadership, provided investments in skills, data infrastructure, and local pilots.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Acknowledge the priority of human-centered transformation and include uniquely human skills in staff training and evaluation standards.</li>
<li>Initiate a digital twin pilot to assess climate risks and cascading failures based in one Kazakhstani city.</li>
<li>Form a cross-sector consortium for data sharing and fusion (satellites, sensors, local sources) with unified rules for quality and transparency.</li>
<li>Implement an AI trust framework in organizations (authority, reliability, accountability, transparency) and link it to executives’ KPIs.</li>
<li>Support and scale the Alem AI initiative as a platform for talent development and applied AI projects.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Conduct a skills audit and role mapping using a “human-centeredness × data structure” matrix, defining trajectories to move into the top-right quadrant.</li>
<li>Launch modular reskilling programs: AI/data and tech literacy + soft skills (empathy, systems thinking, adaptability, leadership).</li>
<li>Create a registry of trusted data sources and uncertainty accounting protocols with regular validation and cross-source comparison.</li>
<li>Prepare pilots: a global air quality map with LLM-based data integration; electricity demand forecasting for grids without full monitoring.</li>
<li>Establish partnerships between local authorities, universities, and international centers (Cardiff, national data centers) to localize models.</li></ul>
