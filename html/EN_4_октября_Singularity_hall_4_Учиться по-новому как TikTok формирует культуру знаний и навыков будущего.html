      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel showed how TikTok is turning into a space for fast and accessible learning: from financial literacy to school subjects and university initiatives. The cases of Freedom Broker, Jump to Mars, and Envision YU demonstrate how simple language, creativity, and AI increase engagement and lower entry barriers. They discussed TikTok’s role as the first touchpoint in the educational ecosystem, support for teachers, and the impact of values-based approaches (GLI) on investment education.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show working models of educational content on TikTok (finance, school subjects, university programs).</li>
<li>Discuss how to simplify complex topics and lower the barrier for newcomers through short formats and dialogue with the audience.</li>
<li>Define the role of TikTok in the learning ecosystem: from first interest to deepening knowledge on other platforms.</li>
<li>Identify best practices for educators and creators: simple language, creativity, humor, drawing on trends.</li>
<li>Assess the potential of AI for visualizing complex concepts and accelerating production of educational content.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How can complex and regulated topics (e.g., investing) be promoted on TikTok without oversimplifying the essence?</li>
<li>Why does educational content resonate with audiences, and which formats work best?</li>
<li>How to find the balance between entertainment and usefulness to motivate further learning?</li>
<li>How do government and community support (for example, «Учителя Казахстана») change the visibility and quality of educational content?</li>
<li>How is AI changing the production and delivery of educational videos, and what should students be taught in the AI era?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>TikTok has become a discovery platform: over 90% of users note that they learn something new; the #LearnOnTikTok hashtag has over 48 million posts, #TeachersOfTikTok has more than 5.5 million posts.</li>
<li>In Kazakhstan, the «Учителя Казахстана» initiative, supported by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, increased the visibility of teachers; more than 800,000 educational videos have been published.</li>
<li>Freedom Broker uses a «one question — one answer» strategy and simple language to explain finance; TikTok acts as the first touchpoint and reduces the fear of the first step in investing.</li>
<li>Freedom Broker content («How to Save a Million Dollars», «Three Must-Have Books for an Investor») gathers millions of views; in some cases, conversions from TikTok outpaced search traffic.</li>
<li>Values-based investing (GLI): at Freedom, the share of women investors grew from ~4% to 48% over two years, thanks in part to initiatives and communication on TikTok.</li>
<li>Jump to Mars combines theory with humor, trends, and science fiction; the goal is to inspire further learning, not replace the lesson.</li>
<li>Teacher communities on TikTok enable the exchange of methods, break complex topics into subtopics, foster professional networking, and influence offline practices.</li>
<li>AI amplifies educational production: it helps visualize complex phenomena and speeds up content creation.</li>
<li>Envision YU removes financial barriers (full-ride grants, housing, meals, transport, stipends) and focuses on leadership, projects, and values.</li>
<li>TikTok is an effective auxiliary tool for school students, especially from remote regions: short, accessible explanations motivate deeper learning.</li></ul>
