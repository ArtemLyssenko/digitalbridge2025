      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The discussion focused on the practical application of AI in the public sector: from education and talent selection to medical robotics. They discussed the economic impact (productivity growth, personalization, reporting), infrastructure prerequisites (data, data centers, GPUs), and risks (ethics, privacy, skill inequality). Local cases were showcased: AI analysis of fiscal receipts, the Bolashak chatbot, mass AI literacy, affordable modular medical robots manufactured in Kazakhstan. A consistent throughline was the human-centric principle: AI as a tool to augment people, not replace them.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Democratize access to AI in education and healthcare while maintaining a human-centric approach</li>
<li>Develop data infrastructure: standards, quality, synthetic data, data centers and supercomputers</li>
<li>Reduce inequality in AI skills through teacher training and mass education programs</li>
<li>Ensure ethical use of AI and protection of personal data in the public sector</li>
<li>Accelerate local R&D and manufacturing (medical robots, AI platforms) for import substitution</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What applied AI scenarios are already working in Kazakhstan's public administration and education?</li>
<li>Can AI be used for preliminary screening of candidates for programs and staff, and is it ethical?</li>
<li>How can the high R&D costs in medical robotics be balanced with affordability for small clinics?</li>
<li>What single change in government using AI would yield the greatest public benefit?</li>
<li>What are the key risks (ethics, privacy, security, inequality) and how can they be minimized?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI in the public sector increases productivity, personalization, and the quality of reporting; economic potential — an additional 2–3% of GDP per year (per McKinsey, Goldman Sachs).</li>
<li>Practical case: comparing statistical and 'real' inflation using data from fiscal receipts via AI-based classification and data cleaning.</li>
<li>The Bolashak program is piloting an AI chatbot based on the regulatory framework and considering predictive models for proactive candidate search; final decisions remain with a human.</li>
<li>Kazakhstani schoolchildren are three-time FIRST Robotics champions; a leap in EdTech and the emergence of a 'unicorn' in education are expected.</li>
<li>Human-centric agenda: the need to strengthen early childhood education (ECE) and socialization in the AI era.</li>
<li>Medical robots: locally developed modular systems (rehabilitation and bone surgical) plan to come to market in 2026–2027; target price ~$100k vs imported $600k–$1M.</li>
<li>AI platforms for universities and clinics are being built locally, with an emphasis on a safe interface and assistive functions (prompts, interpretation, CV), not automatic decision-making.</li>
<li>Infrastructure is a critical factor: data centers, access to GPUs/supercomputers, standards, and data 'cleanliness'; 'data is the new gold.'</li>
<li>Risks: privacy and personal data leaks, widening AI skill inequality, ethical dilemmas, and possible 'dependence' on models; remedies — regulation, education, guardrails, and transparency.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Artificial intelligence will not replace people; it is people who master artificial intelligence who will replace others.” — <span class="author">Adil Kusmanov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI should bring improvements but should not make judgments and decisions for you.” — <span class="author">Dr. Prashant K. Jamwal</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“GPU is the new asset, the new wealth today.” — <span class="author">Dr. Prashant K. Jamwal</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI in Kazakhstan's public sector is already delivering practical benefits (tax analytics, chatbots, mass training) and will expand with the development of data and compute infrastructure.</li>
<li>A human-centric strategy, early development, and teacher preparation are key to reducing inequality and achieving a sustainable AI impact.</li>
<li>Local production of affordable medical robots and AI platforms increases sovereignty and makes high technology accessible to clinics.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Continue and expand the pilot of the Bolashak AI chatbot and consider predictive selection models while keeping the final decision with a human.</li>
<li>Launch large-scale internships and teacher upskilling in AI as the core of spreading AI literacy to schools and regions.</li>
<li>Focus public policy on developing data infrastructure: standardization, quality, synthetic data, data centers, and access to GPUs/supercomputers.</li>
<li>Support commercialization of local medical robots and AI platforms with a view to implementation in public and private clinics by 2026–2027.</li>
<li>Strengthen the human-centric approach and consider institutional strengthening of early childhood education (ECE) as a priority.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Create an interagency working group on ECE+AI (early development, content, ethics, impact metrics).</li>
<li>Develop and approve unified data governance standards in the public sector (cataloging, cleaning, access, synthetic data).</li>
<li>Prepare a grant and pilot program for deploying modular medical robots and AI platforms in regional clinics.</li>
<li>Launch a train-the-trainers track for teachers and update AI teaching methodologies in schools and universities.</li>
<li>Develop regulatory 'ethical guardrails' for AI systems in education and healthcare (transparency, ban on automatic judgments, audit).</li>
<li>Expand access to computing resources (data centers, GPU pools, supercomputer) for universities, startups, and government agencies under a shared-resource model.</li></ul>
