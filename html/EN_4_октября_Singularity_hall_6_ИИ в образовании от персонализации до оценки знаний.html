      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how AI scales learning without loss of quality and shifts the teacher into a mentor role, how personalization is built on data and knowledge graphs, why Kazakhstan is ahead of the region in online education and EdTech exports, and which infrastructure and regulatory conditions (GPUs/energy, data protection) are critical for sustainable adoption.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Scale access to quality learning through AI and automation while maintaining academic performance.</li>
<li>Build personalized pathways based on data and local models for schools and supplementary education.</li>
<li>Establish national standards for protecting student data and practices of responsible AI.</li>
<li>Develop domestic AI infrastructure (GPUs/energy) and support local LLMs/startups.</li>
<li>Accelerate the export of Kazakhstani EdTech solutions to the markets of Central Asia and the CIS.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to ensure quality control when one teacher supports hundreds of students with the help of AI?</li>
<li>What is the role of large language models in school: external services vs. local/industry models?</li>
<li>How to protect children’s personal data and avoid repeating the 'mistake of the 90s' of transferring assets abroad?</li>
<li>How to motivate learners and preserve the national identity of content amid global AI platforms?</li>
<li>What steps can turn the teacher shortage and multi-shift schooling into a 'big plus' through technology?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI already handles up to 60% of operational processing and support; with targeted automation, one teacher can support 100–300+ students online.</li>
<li>Savings from automation should be reinvested into R&D teams and bringing in experts to accelerate innovation.</li>
<li>Daryn Online has 20k video lessons and ~8 TB of learning data; 90% of revenue is B2C; active expansion into Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan.</li>
<li>Personalization is built through a 'tree' of knowledge: detecting gaps and adaptive remediation, starting from fundamental topics (example — 8th grade).</li>
<li>Teachers are used as an 'information window' and mentors, and AI as an assistant and a channel for daily push notifications to drive discipline and retention.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan is ahead of its neighbors: up to 80% of schoolchildren receive supplementary education online (versus ~30% in a number of neighboring countries).</li>
<li>LLMs are not a 'thinking mind' but a probabilistic predictor (akin to T9); value comes from proper task framing and training on relevant local data.</li>
<li>Government decisions during the pandemic (open competition, rejection of a single monopoly platform, market support) accelerated the development of EdTech.</li>
<li>A GDPR‑like protection regime is needed: children's audio/video/voice are sensitive data; the risk of leakage to foreign AI services (OpenAI, Perplexity) demands localization and sovereign storage.</li>
<li>A breakthrough requires AI infrastructure (GPUs, energy); Kazakhstan's mining experience shows the potential: AI is the 'new oil', a window of opportunity for technological leadership.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“One teacher can teach a hundred students online… going forward we want to maintain quality with 300–650 students per teacher.” — <span class="author">Askar Maksatuly</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In artificial intelligence, Kazakhstan and all other countries are on the same level.” — <span class="author">Askar Bolat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The teacher will become a mentor, while platforms and AI assistants will take over academic tasks.” — <span class="author">Gabit Bekakhmetov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We must not repeat the mistake of the nineties—handing over data to foreign systems. Children's data should work for domestic companies.” — <span class="author">Gabit Bekakhmetov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In recent years, the state has been quick to respond to changes: over the next five years there will be many projects in AI.” — <span class="author">Bolat Ashim</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI enables radically expanding reach and personalizing learning, shifting the teacher into a mentor role.</li>
<li>The key to sustainability is local data, sovereign infrastructure, and strict protection of student privacy.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan can convert demographic growth and talent shortages into a competitive advantage by exporting EdTech solutions to the region.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Recommend implementing personalized AI assistants and daily motivational scenarios in school and out-of-school programs.</li>
<li>Initiate the development of national rules for protecting children's data (analogous to GDPR) and a ban on the careless uploading of personal data to foreign AI services.</li>
<li>Establish a program to develop AI infrastructure (GPU capacity, energy base) and support local LLMs/startups for education.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Create a working group with the Ministry of Education and Science and the market for 3–6-month pilots of AI mentors in 100+ schools with metrics on quality and teacher workload.</li>
<li>Develop and test an 'AI Literacy Test' for 9th grade as a standard for assessing readiness to use AI in learning.</li>
<li>Publish industry privacy guidelines (anonymization, storage, access) and a list of permissible scenarios for working with children's data.</li>
<li>Conduct an audit of available GPU/energy resources and plan the scaling of data centers for educational AI services.</li>
<li>Organize a teacher upskilling program for the mentor role (mentoring practices, working with AI assistants, AI ethics).</li></ul>
