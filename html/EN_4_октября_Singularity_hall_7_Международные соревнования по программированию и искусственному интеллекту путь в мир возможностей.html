      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how programming and AI olympiads become a springboard into a career: from early preparation and logical thinking to real offers and international trajectories. The Kazakhstani experience was showcased: success at the international AI olympiad was ensured by an early start and large-scale training. Age and methodological approaches, the role of English and teamwork, as well as scaling mechanisms — events, regional drivers, media, and translations of materials — were discussed.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show the role of international olympiads in building a career in IT and AI</li>
<li>Define an effective training trajectory (age, foundation, training regimen)</li>
<li>Share the Kazakhstan case of organizing and winning AI olympiads</li>
<li>Discuss scaling the experience beyond elite schools to the regions</li>
<li>Identify employer requirements (English, algorithms, teamwork) and realistic expectations from olympiad achievements</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>From what age and how exactly should one start preparing for competitive programming and AI olympiads?</li>
<li>Which skills and foundations (logic, mathematics, data structures) are critical for success?</li>
<li>How do olympiads translate into career opportunities and job offers from companies?</li>
<li>How to scale preparation to the regions and beyond NIS/BIL/RFMSH?</li>
<li>How important are English and networking for passing interviews and working in BigTech?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>An early start and systematic training provide a decisive advantage in AI olympiads; in Kazakhstan, training began long before deadlines, selecting the strongest from hundreds of children.</li>
<li>Optimal path: in grades 6–7 develop logic and mathematics, from grade 8 — programming; reaching the international level requires daily practice with a coach.</li>
<li>Career foundation: algorithms and data structures, mathematical base, ability to work in a team, and system design.</li>
<li>English is a mandatory requirement: even strong olympiad participants fail interviews without confident proficiency.</li>
<li>Olympiad achievements increase the chances of job offers, but do not guarantee employment — applied preparation and additional training for industry tasks are necessary.</li>
<li>Scaling is possible through regional drivers: teacher-mentors, regular events, training camps, media coverage, and translations of materials into Kazakh/Russian.</li>
<li>The federation and the community expanded reach: open olympiads and training camps led to participation by school students from rural districts and victories on the international stage.</li>
<li>Access to knowledge is democratized: YouTube and free courses from leading universities allow one to start with minimal costs.</li>
<li>Social barriers are lower: success is determined by discipline and regularity of study, not only by “giftedness” or an elite school.</li>
<li>Digital Nomads Kazakhstan maintains the diaspora’s connection with ecosystem development inside the country, including open lectures and exchange of practices.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“On average, it’s better to start programming from grade 8, and before that — build up logic.” — <span class="author">Temirlan Satylkhanov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Our secret — we started preparing very early, while many countries got involved a month before the start.” — <span class="author">Kuanysh Oteu</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Without English, even finalists don’t pass interviews.” — <span class="author">Yeldan Abdrashim</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Children need drivers in the regions: events and coaches — then they will catch up on their own.” — <span class="author">Kuanysh Oteu</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Programming and AI olympiads are an effective path into the industry provided there is a strong algorithmic foundation and English proficiency.</li>
<li>Early mass preparation, regional mentors, and regular events are critical for improving national results.</li>
<li>Media, translations, and open courses lower entry barriers and broaden the geography of talent beyond elite schools.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Decided to expand the network of regional coaches and federation points of presence (Aktau, Semey, etc.) for systematic selection and training of school students.</li>
<li>Decided to translate and structure learning materials on algorithms and ML into Kazakh and Russian and distribute them to schools.</li>
<li>Decided to hold a series of open AI events and training camps (at least 3 next year) with early selection and training content.</li>
<li>Decided to launch pilot modules on ML/AI in school computer science courses with support from mentors from the community.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Prepare an annual calendar of olympiads, training camps, and regional selections, including the AI track.</li>
<li>Form a list of mentors and coaches by region and launch a program for their upskilling.</li>
<li>Publish a package of open materials: roadmaps on algorithms/ML, links to courses, and a set of problems translated into Kazakh/Russian.</li>
<li>Organize a series of open lectures and hands-on workshops together with Digital Nomads Kazakhstan and partner universities.</li>
<li>Develop an English track for olympiad participants (preparation for technical interviews, speaking/tech writing) and integrate it into the training camps.</li></ul>
