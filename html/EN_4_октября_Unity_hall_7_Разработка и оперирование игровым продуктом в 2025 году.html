      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The speaker unpacked the post-COVID dynamics of the games market, the unexpected growth of the PC segment, and the 'red ocean' of mobile casual. He showed how the release of GTA VI in 2026 will affect investments and consumer behavior. He noted growing interest in mid/hardcore products and auteur games. He concluded with practical principles for studios and a sober view of the role of AI as a tool to accelerate and improve development.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Understand the key trends of 2020–2025 and their impact on revenue and platforms</li>
<li>Assess the prospects of mobile versus PC and the onset of the 'red ocean' in casual</li>
<li>Analyze the potential effect of the release of GTA VI on the market, players, and investments</li>
<li>Formulate product strategy principles for 2025–2026</li>
<li>Outline practical ways to implement AI in production without loss of quality</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to make money in the mobile segment amid oversaturation in casual and expensive marketing?</li>
<li>Should independent studios shift to mid/hardcore, and which niches are underfilled?</li>
<li>How will the release of GTA VI change release windows, competition for attention, and investors' willingness to finance new projects?</li>
<li>Which growth platforms are relevant beyond the store: PC, consoles, messengers, service models?</li>
<li>How to implement AI as a tool to augment the team rather than replace competencies?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The post-COVID peak of 2020–2021 was followed by a correction; 2025 is expected to be about +2% and ~$190 billion.</li>
<li>Mobile casual has moved into a 'red ocean': competition and acquisition costs make hits for small teams nearly unattainable.</li>
<li>On mobile, interest in mid/hardcore is growing, but there are few high-quality, innovative releases—an opportunity window for studios.</li>
<li>PC is growing thanks to the loosening of console exclusivity (Sony, Microsoft) and a more 'hardcore' audience after COVID.</li>
<li>The market is consolidating: an active M&A agenda and veterans moving into independent development facilitate attracting investment.</li>
<li>Live-service games are in crisis: numerous financial failures and shutdowns, fatigue among players and investors.</li>
<li>Auteur AA/indie projects confirm commercial potential: examples include KCD II, Death Stranding 2, Hades II, Silksong.</li>
<li>GTA VI with a ~$2 billion budget is a media event of planetary scale; break-even is estimated at around 40 million copies.</li>
<li>GTA VI will compete for time not with games but with Netflix/Amazon; this will widen the funnel of new players and revive investment.</li>
<li>Practice: look for inspiration outside gamedev, use native ads in games, explore messengers and AI agents.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Everything that will be said is solely my point of view; it may be subjective, incorrect, and require further verification.” — <span class="author">Anton Andreychenko</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“On mobile we are seeing the formation of a red ocean in the casual genre.” — <span class="author">Anton Andreychenko</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The audience has become much more selective, and it is looking for what truly interests it.” — <span class="author">Anton Andreychenko</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Rockstar needs to sell only forty million copies to break even.” — <span class="author">Anton Andreychenko</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI is an amazing tool, but still a tool.” — <span class="author">Anton Andreychenko</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Strategic focus is shifting to PC and mid/hardcore mobile, where competition is lower and audience willingness to pay is higher.</li>
<li>The release of GTA VI will expand the market audience and strengthen investors' appetite for financing new and even risky projects.</li>
<li>Studios need to balance auteur vision, audience interest, and commercial viability.</li>
<li>AI will speed up and reduce the cost of production but will not compensate for weak competencies—intentional onboarding of tools is needed.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Focus on developing mid/hardcore mobile products instead of casual.</li>
<li>Expand research beyond gamedev: TV series, pop culture, TikTok trends to find non-trivial product moves.</li>
<li>Implement native ads and brand collaborations as an additional revenue source.</li>
<li>Test new distribution platforms, including messengers (Telegram) and PC.</li>
<li>Use AI as a production tool, training the team in basic prompting principles and pipelines.</li>
<li>Plan release windows with the media effect of GTA VI and possible cannibalization of attention in mind.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Audit the portfolio and marketing: reduce investments in casual, outline 1–2 mid/hardcore verticals.</li>
<li>Prepare a PC strategy: assess porting/cross-play, build requirements, marketing channels (Steam, EGS).</li>
<li>Prototype a game for a messenger (Telegram) and validate CPI/retention metrics on a pilot audience in Asia.</li>
<li>Launch a native ads pilot in the current flagship: 1–2 brand collaborations, define revenue KPIs and NPS.</li>
<li>Create an AI roadmap: choose tools for art/code generation/localization, train the team, quality policy.</li>
<li>Prepare a calendar of releases and major updates with a ±2-month buffer around the launch of GTA VI.</li>
<li>Research trends outside games (top streaming, pop culture, UGC) and integrate findings into the content plan.</li>
<li>Refine the pitch deck for investors with an emphasis on post-GTA growth and underfilled niches.</li></ul>
