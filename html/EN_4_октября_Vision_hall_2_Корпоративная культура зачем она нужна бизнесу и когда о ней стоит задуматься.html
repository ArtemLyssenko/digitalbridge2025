      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed corporate culture as a key advantage in the competition for talent: from startups to international corporations. Emphasis — personal development roadmaps and leadership principles (Amazon experience), candidates’ demand for innovation and well-being, working with zoomers through compelling products and flexibility. Global cultural standards are combined with local specifics, especially in highly regulated industries where it is important to balance innovation and safety.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Understand which elements of corporate culture truly attract and retain strong professionals.</li>
<li>Compare approaches to culture in startups and large companies, including international ones.</li>
<li>Figure out when and how to start systematically building corporate culture.</li>
<li>Identify the expectations of zoomers and AI specialists toward employers.</li>
<li>Show how to integrate innovation (AI) without compromising safety and regulatory compliance.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What do top candidates pay attention to besides compensation when choosing an employer?</li>
<li>How to attract and retain zoomers and AI developers in an early-stage startup?</li>
<li>When should a company start investing in corporate culture, and how should it be scaled?</li>
<li>How does a global corporate culture align with local market specifics?</li>
<li>Does corporate culture influence the trust of investors and long-term partners?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Development roadmaps and training to global standards are a strong retention factor (practices from Amazon/Meta are ported into a startup).</li>
<li>ProHunters research: high candidate interest in companies related to AI and innovation; focus on well-being and development is a key trend.</li>
<li>For zoomers, interesting challenges, real user impact of the product, flexible schedules, and a clear hiring funnel are critical.</li>
<li>Startups attract through the founder’s personality and values; large companies — through predictable systems, career mobility ladders, and stability.</li>
<li>A leader is a role model: without their daily involvement, values “die” on the periphery of a large organization.</li>
<li>Culture must be codified into principles and processes (transparent goals, talent management), otherwise change stalls.</li>
<li>Global corporations maintain a unified culture but execute it through local teams, keeping a balance between innovation and strict regulatory compliance.</li>
<li>Culture is an evolutionary process: it changes as the company grows and as market challenges evolve.</li>
<li>Practical flexibility in the office environment and daily life (location, amenities, schedule) is part of the real culture of everyday experience.</li>
<li>Culture affects the trust of customers and investors: long-term commitments and resilience are important for partnerships and regulated markets.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Read about Amazon’s leadership principles and apply them in your company.” — <span class="author">Beibit Baktygaliev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Look, folks, there’s a roadmap, there’s a plan, there’s a project. Your job is just to follow it, and in a year you’ll definitely be there. And most likely, even further.” — <span class="author">Beibit Baktygaliev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“If you don’t cover material motivation, no corporate culture will save you.” — <span class="author">Renata Nureeva</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We don’t adapt. The whole story of being a global company is to make sure that your corporate culture is the same everywhere.” — <span class="author">Jerome Boye</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Corporate culture is a practical tool for competing for talent: development, impact on the product, and well-being matter more than perks.</li>
<li>In large companies, culture rests on role-model leadership and formalized principles; in startups — on the founder’s personality and the interest of the problems being solved.</li>
<li>Global players maintain unified values but scale innovation through local teams, preserving a priority on safety and compliance.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Agreed to communicate and formalize leadership principles and development roadmaps for employees.</li>
<li>Decided to strengthen the focus on employee well-being and transparent communication about management style.</li>
<li>Agreed to prioritize interesting, market-relevant AI tasks that increase developers’ visible contribution.</li>
<li>Decided to combine innovation with safety and regulatory requirements when bringing solutions to market.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Audit current practices: formalize leadership principles and career development roadmaps for key roles.</li>
<li>Launch/continue participation in the study «Рейтинг работодателей Казахстана», collect employee feedback.</li>
<li>Embed flexible schedules for students/juniors and automate the hiring funnel (test assignments, auto-parsing).</li>
<li>Develop a well-being program: communications, prevention, access to specialists, participation metrics.</li>
<li>Create a mechanism for selecting and piloting AI initiatives with assessments of safety, compliance, and business impact.</li></ul>
