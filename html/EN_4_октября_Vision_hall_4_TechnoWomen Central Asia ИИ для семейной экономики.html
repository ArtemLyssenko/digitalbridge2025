      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session focused on reducing women's poverty through the development of digital and AI skills, presented the results of the projects «IT Айель» and «Акылтек» (20,000+ women trained over 3 years; 11,000+ registrations in the current wave; 5,000+ obtained professions), showed cases of career transitions and entrepreneurship, and announced scaling of the program to the regions of Kazakhstan and the countries of Central Asia with the support of partners.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show the socio-economic impact of the projects «IT Айель» and «Акылтек» for women and the family economy</li>
<li>Present key metrics, employment and entrepreneurship cases of graduates</li>
<li>Consolidate partnerships for regional and cross-country scaling (CA)</li>
<li>Mobilize resources of the National Commission, NGOs, and business for sustainable support of women's digital competencies</li>
<li>Align tools for monitoring results and further support of graduates</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to overcome the disparity: a high contribution of large families to demography and a high share of poverty among them?</li>
<li>Which digital and AI skills are most in demand and deliver quick economic impact for women?</li>
<li>How to ensure accessible training for women from regions and vulnerable groups (maternity leave, low income)?</li>
<li>What scaling model across Central Asia and content localization is most effective?</li>
<li>How to build post-training support: mentorship, employment, entrepreneurial support?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>According to IRC, about 90% of the poor in the country are members of large families; the priority is investment in women as heads of households.</li>
<li>The National Commission for Women is a network of 35 members and regional commissions under akims plus freelance gender advisors; its function is to unite projects in social, family, demographic, and gender policy.</li>
<li>Techno Women has expanded from Kazakhstan to Central Asia and the UAE; a community of 1,000+ participants from rank-and-file specialists to SEO and managers.</li>
<li>The projects «IT Айель» (for women) and «Акылтек» (for youth up to 35) provide online training on an LMS across three tracks: cybersecurity, financial literacy, digital entrepreneurship/first IT professions.</li>
<li>Over three years, «IT Айель» trained around 20,000 women; 11,000+ participants are registered in the current cycle; more than 5,000 obtained new professions and income growth.</li>
<li>Regional dynamics: youth are most active in Almaty and Astana; among women graduates, Shymkent and Karaganda lead.</li>
<li>Cases: employment at EPAM; launching and scaling startups (for example, Face Fit Nation), implementing AI in the document flow of НГС, EdTech and social projects («Жарқыра» trained 1,000+ women).</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence accelerates the transformation of the labor market; it is important for women not to fall behind and to increase the intensity of learning.</li>
<li>Partner ecosystem: the Ministry of Culture and Sports of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Center for Support of Civil Initiatives, Astana Hub, the UN, ESA Education, the Kazakhstan Center for Digital Rights, and others.</li>
<li>Grants and internships announced: the top 100 — training at Astana Hub, internships in the USA and grants for MBA programs, courses in marketing and cyber law.</li></ul>
