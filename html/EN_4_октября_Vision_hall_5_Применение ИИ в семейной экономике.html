      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session showcased applied AI use cases for household economics: from mass housing savings and digital services of Отбасы Банк to the agentic AI Mama Care application to support young mothers. The sustainability of the closed housing savings model, the role of educational deposits, and new government support for children were discussed. Issues of ethics and inclusion (gender and age balance in governance), as well as the acute need for financial literacy and anti-fraud among youth, were addressed. Participants initiated collaborations between IT and medicine and put forward the idea of an AI assistant for financial literacy.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show how AI is already increasing the efficiency of household finances and social services (housing, education, motherhood).</li>
<li>Discuss architectures and practices for deploying AI agents in mass services (chatbots, RAG, multilingualism).</li>
<li>Align cross-sector collaborations between banks, universities, and the medical community.</li>
<li>Highlight risks and values: ethics, inclusion, combating fraud, support for the Kazakh language.</li>
<li>Increase awareness of housing and educational savings programs for families.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How can AI be used to strengthen household economics without losing national and family values?</li>
<li>Which AI model and architecture are best suited for 24/7 support of young mothers (agents, RAG, multilingualism)?</li>
<li>Will the AI Mama Care application be free, and what is a sustainable model for its development?</li>
<li>Are large institutions ready to delegate part of their functions to AI (for example, an “independent director”), and how can gender and age balance be preserved?</li>
<li>Which AI tools are most effective for mass improvement of financial literacy and reduction of fraud among youth?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The closed housing savings model reduces risks: depositors’ funds are directed only to housing loans; NPL ≈ 0.1%.</li>
<li>Отбасы Банк: 3,378,951 depositors; 2.5–2.7 thousand deposits opened daily; since the beginning of the year ≈ 669,732 new deposits; 622 thousand families improved their housing conditions (≈2.5 million people, based on an average family size of 3.8).</li>
<li>Rate stability is achieved by the model: with a base rate of 16.5% and market deposits at 17–19%, the bank offers low rates on housing loans thanks to the closed system and pooling of deposits (on average 4 deposits per one loan).</li>
<li>AQYL educational deposits: bank rate + annual state bonus of 5% (general) or 7% (for СУСН); new government support from August — a one-time contribution to children (235,920 KZT; for orphans — 471,840 KZT) with the amount growing by age 18.</li>
<li>Отбасы Банк’s «Куаныш» chatbot on AWS handles 97% of requests without an operator, responds in 3–4 seconds; volume — ≈370 thousand chats/month with a plan to grow to 500 thousand; a voice AI assistant is under development with an emphasis on the Kazakh language.</li>
<li>AI Mama Care is a 24/7 agentic application to support young mothers: personalization, semantic search across a knowledge base, RAG approach, multilingualism (Kaz/Rus/Eng); partner — the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University (KazNMU).</li>
<li>Media content in the Kazakh language is limited; multilingual embeddings and models make it possible to expand the knowledge base and provide contextually complete answers.</li>
<li>Financial fraud hits young people (droppers, “running” funds); the National Bank is launching an anti-fraud center with labeling of suspicious accounts — mass financial literacy is critical.</li>
<li>Inclusive and multi-age boards of directors make more balanced and transparent decisions; skepticism toward replacing independent directors with a “female image” of AI.</li>
<li>Collaboration between IT and medicine has been initiated: expansion of AI Mama Care (lactation, relactation) and the idea of a unified ecosystem for mothers; an AI assistant for financial literacy for youth was proposed.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“A person has two dreams, even three: to be healthy, to be educated, and to have their own apartment.” — <span class="author">Ibragimova Lyazzat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“It feels as if a virtual woman would be more obedient than a real one.” — <span class="author">Ibragimova Lyazzat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Education will be a very powerful and very expensive asset.” — <span class="author">Ibragimova Lyazzat</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI is already bringing tangible benefits to families: speeding up access to housing, improving support for young mothers, and enhancing the quality of digital services.</li>
<li>For a sustainable effect, interdisciplinary collaborations (bank–university–medicine), development of content in Kazakh, and systemic work on financial literacy and anti-fraud are necessary.</li>
<li>Inclusivity and diversity in corporate governance remain more important than symbolic AI substitutions; the ethics of implementation must go hand in hand with technological progress.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Agreement on collaboration of AI Mama Care with breastfeeding and relactation experts to create a unified ecosystem for supporting mothers.</li>
<li>Decided to continue and accelerate the development of the voice AI assistant of Отбасы Банк with a priority on the quality of the Kazakh language.</li>
<li>Decided to elaborate the idea of an AI assistant for financial literacy for youth together with relevant partners (universities, banks, government agencies).</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Form a working group (Al-Farabi Kazakh National University (KazNU), Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University (KazNMU), lactation experts) to integrate AI Mama Care modules and expand the knowledge base in three languages.</li>
<li>Prepare an MVP of AI Mama Care and launch closed testing within 2–3 months; collect answer quality and safety metrics.</li>
<li>Conduct a pilot of the voice AI assistant of Отбасы Банк; measure the reduction of call center load and the quality of dialogues in the Kazakh language.</li>
<li>Work out the concept of an AI assistant for financial literacy with the participation of the National Bank (anti-fraud content), the Ministry of Education and Science, and Отбасы Банк; define target audiences (students, young families).</li>
<li>Launch an information campaign about AQYL educational deposits and new government support measures for children; prepare materials in Kazakh and Russian.</li>
<li>Develop a policy for validating medical content (evidence-based), and privacy and ethics regulations for AI Mama Care.</li></ul>
