      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The discussion focused on building a resilient AI ecosystem through infrastructure (GPU, supercomputers, telecom, energy) and open data, and on balancing innovation and regulation with trust at the center. Fintech and telecom leaders showed how super apps and AI-based personal assistants are reshaping customer experience and monetization. Risks of irresponsible generative AI development and the need for corporate accountability were noted. It was shown how AI and big data enhance climate security and early warning systems.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Build a resilient national AI ecosystem based on computing, telecommunications, and energy infrastructure</li>
<li>Ensure business and startup access to capacity (GPU/HPC) and high-quality de-identified data via open APIs</li>
<li>Strike a balance between innovation and regulation, strengthening the accountability of major AI players and reducing systemic risks</li>
<li>Develop customer-centric ecosystems and personal assistants that improve users’ everyday lives</li>
<li>Use AI to improve the accuracy of climate forecasting and early warning systems</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What concrete steps by government and business will accelerate Kazakhstan’s transformation into an “AI country”?</li>
<li>How can we overcome the shortage of computing resources and ensure scalable data access while protecting privacy?</li>
<li>What accountability and safety mechanisms are needed for generative AI and its leaders?</li>
<li>Which fintech and telecom segments will be the first to be transformed by AI and super‑apps?</li>
<li>How can AI strengthen climate security and cross-border early warning systems?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI infrastructure: two national supercomputers have been launched (Казахтелеком + Ministry of Digital Development) for cloud access for startups — an answer to the shortage and high cost of NVIDIA chips</li>
<li>Data as AI fuel: it is important for the state to open de-identified data via Open APIs with strict privacy protection</li>
<li>Trust is the key asset: don’t over-tighten regulation; support entrepreneurship and responsible business behavior</li>
<li>Generative AI risks: competition and greed among leaders can crowd out safety; legal liability and mechanisms for lawsuits are needed</li>
<li>Three scenarios for AI’s future (Kai‑Fu Li): a dystopia of control; safety engineering in cooperation with the state; the “best” AI aligned with human needs</li>
<li>Ecosystem “battle for gravity” (Turlov): interaction frequency, loyalty, and monetization determine winners against stand‑alone services</li>
<li>Super app as a platform for AI agents: unified APIs accelerate the rollout of personal assistants; Freedom has already launched a business assistant and is preparing a mass-market release</li>
<li>Practical AI in fintech (Kaspi): a “smart and reliable assistant” for SMBs and consumers — improving product cards, descriptions, and travel selection; over a 5‑year horizon, consolidation among survivors is expected</li>
<li>AI for climate (WMO): huge observational datasets + AI increase the accuracy of forecasts and early warning programs; “weather has no borders”</li>
<li>Telecom as AI’s foundation: 4G/5G, spectrum, data centers, and energy are critical; Tele2 is deploying a voice AI assistant (+70% service speed) and AI-powered network optimization; pro‑investor regulation and data policy are important</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“To accelerate AI transformation, we need two more things — AI infrastructure and access to data via open, de-identified APIs.” — <span class="author">Bagdat Musin</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Generative intelligence will be better than 90% of people at 90% of tasks within five years.” — <span class="author">Kai-Fu Li</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The battle between ecosystems is turning into a battle for gravity.” — <span class="author">Timur Turlov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The future belongs to a smart assistant you can entrust with everyday tasks — while decisions are made by a person.” — <span class="author">Mikhail Lomtadze</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“No AI ecosystem will work without powerful modern telecommunications.” — <span class="author">Mikhail Gerchuk</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Weather has no borders.” — <span class="author">Abdulla Ahmed Al-Mandus</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Sustainable progress in AI requires synchronized development of infrastructure (HPC, chips, data centers, energy, 5G) and access regimes for high-quality data</li>
<li>The key to scale is trust and proper regulatory design: privacy protection, open data, and players’ responsibility for AI safety</li>
<li>The ecosystem approach and personal assistants are becoming the primary interface for citizens and businesses to interact with digital services</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Казахтелеком together with the Ministry of Digital Development will commission two supercomputers and provide cloud access to startups and corporations</li>
<li>The government will expand the practice of open de-identified data via Open APIs to support domestic AI teams</li>
<li>Tele2 (with the participation of Power International Holding) is launching a voice AI assistant and scaling AI-driven network optimization in parallel with investments in 5G</li>
<li>Freedom has launched an AI assistant for business and in the coming months will roll out a personal assistant for mass users, providing free access to leading paid AI models in the super app</li>
<li>WMO is strengthening its participation in the early warning initiative and expanding the use of AI models to improve the accuracy of climate forecasts</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Prepare an Open Data roadmap: de-identification, API standards, SLAs, and priority access for researchers and startups</li>
<li>Agree on a data policy with the regulator: balancing privacy and beneficial use, including aggregated telecom data</li>
<li>Publish a phased plan for releasing radio spectrum for 5G/6G and simplify allocation procedures</li>
<li>Launch a program of subsidized access to GPU/HPC for universities and startups based on national supercomputers</li>
<li>Create a cross-sector council on AI safety and accountability: standards, audits, incident response, and legal accountability</li>
<li>Run pilots of AI assistants in government services and fintech with KPIs on quality, economics, and user trust</li>
<li>Organize joint projects by WMO, universities, and business on climate AI and “early warnings for all” systems</li>
<li>Develop energy-efficient data centers (including RES and PUE targets) as a foundation for growing AI workloads</li></ul>
