      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>Participants discussed how to build end-to-end coordination of development institutions across the entire innovation lifecycle — from idea and R&D to export. Two systemic initiatives were proposed: an “Innovation ID Passport” for projects and a monthly “Innovation Task Force” to synchronize priorities. The key focus was on implementing AI and shared big data to route applicants, accelerate expert review, and reduce costs. Special attention was given to commercialization of science, prioritizing areas by market size, and integration with the export agenda.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Create a single support pathway for projects through development institutions based on the “Innovation ID Passport.”</li>
<li>Implement AI and shared big data for selection, monitoring, and expert procedures throughout the innovation cycle.</li>
<li>Synchronize the priorities of institutions and eliminate duplication of support instruments.</li>
<li>Speed up and simplify patenting and increase the commercialization of R&D results.</li>
<li>Form a market focus on non-commodity exports and new value chains.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How can we eliminate duplication of institutional functions and provide a clear route for scientists, startups, and businesses?</li>
<li>Which grant and expert procedure blocks can be safely automated with AI within the legal framework?</li>
<li>How can we shorten timelines and simplify obtaining patents while ensuring international IP protection?</li>
<li>Do we need a single “fund of funds” or several players for venture financing, and how can they be coordinated?</li>
<li>How can we quickly assemble and operationalize shared big data (data, infrastructure, talent) for the ecosystem’s AI services?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The country needs to move from digitalization to deep-tech industrialization and to increase economic complexity; the target is new value chains and non-commodity exports.</li>
<li>According to Pol Romer, competitiveness is determined by human capital and R&D investment; Kazakhstan needs to strengthen both factors.</li>
<li>Prioritization should be based on global market size and local competencies, including the “hidden champions” approach.</li>
<li>The innovation lifecycle (idea – science – IP – prototype – production – export) in the Republic of Kazakhstan is covered by many institutions, but there is duplication and a “maze” for applicants.</li>
<li>Systemic solutions were proposed: an “Innovation ID Passport” for projects and an “Innovation Task Force” with monthly synchronization of institutions.</li>
<li>Shared big data and AI agents can proactively route projects by stages and institutions (science, IP, financing, export).</li>
<li>The Science Fund is expanding its mandate: acceleration and venture; the “АйСана” program will cover 650,000 students, 100,000 — advanced courses; up to 1,500 projects are expected.</li>
<li>Казпатент notes low commercialization of patents; the plan is to simplify and speed up examination with AI, develop technology support centers, and use patent analytics.</li>
<li>KIC and the «Байтэрек» holding are implementing AI in client interactions and see basic requirements for AI success: data, infrastructure, talent; it is proposed to use the «Damu» network as a single front office.</li>
<li>БРК is introducing AI and a product approach: the processing stage has been reduced from 5 business days to 10 minutes; data warehouses and auto-generation of conclusions are being formed.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We must build the real economy — high-tech plants, not basins and nails.” — <span class="author">Zholdykhan Sanat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“An innovation passport should appear, an ID to see what stage the project is at and who is supporting it.” — <span class="author">Zholdykhan Sanat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Of all the issued invention patents, commercialization is practically zero.” — <span class="author">Akhmetov Sabit Meiramovich</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“This is not just artificial intelligence courses; it is a full-scale acceleration program.” — <span class="author">Ashkin Arman</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“To develop AI, you need data, infrastructure, and talent.” — <span class="author">Karymsakov Didar Nurlybekovich</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The first stage of the process used to take five business days; now it is ten minutes.” — <span class="author">Yelibayev Marat</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Without coordination among institutions, innovation development stalls due to duplication and the gap between science, financing, IP, and export.</li>
<li>AI and shared big data can sharply increase the speed and quality of institutional services, reduce costs, and make the applicant’s journey transparent.</li>
<li>Market-based prioritization and a focus on commercialization are critical for growing non-commodity exports and economic complexity.</li>
<li>Using existing infrastructure (for example, the «Damu» front offices) will accelerate scaling of a business “single window.”</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Create a working group under the auspices of Kaz Innovation to develop the concept of the “Innovation ID Passport” and a digital lifecycle map.</li>
<li>Form an “Innovation Task Force” with monthly meetings of development institutions to synchronize priorities and exchange data.</li>
<li>Use the «Damu» branch network as a single front office for consultations on support measures of all institutions; Kaz Innovation will facilitate the alignment.</li>
<li>Prepare a pilot for AI automation of intake and formal checks of Science Fund grant applications.</li>
<li>Begin implementing AI tools at Казпатент to speed up examination and prior-art searches, and to strengthen technology support centers.</li>
<li>Deploy data warehouses and auto-analytics algorithms at БРК/KIC with KPIs for reducing timelines and costs.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Kaz Innovation: within 30 days, prepare a draft concept of the “Innovation ID Passport” and requirements for the shared data lake.</li>
<li>Science Fund: design an AI pilot for intake and validation of applications; define the legal framework for AI use in expert review.</li>
<li>Казпатент: launch an AI pilot for prior-art search and proposals to shorten examination timelines; a plan to engage private companies.</li>
<li>БРК and KIC: implement corporate data warehouses and auto-generation of conclusions; present initial metrics (TAT, OPEX savings).</li>
<li>«Damu» and the «Байтерек» holding: roll out a unified advisory module on support measures, train front offices on the institutions’ scripts.</li>
<li>KazTrade: prepare a marketing map of niches for non-commodity exports with an emphasis on parts/components using the “hidden champions” model.</li>
<li>Joint data group: agree on data standards, access, and security; form an IT systems integration roadmap.</li>
<li>Task force organizing committee: set the dates and agenda for the first three monthly meetings, invite representatives of business and industry associations.</li></ul>
