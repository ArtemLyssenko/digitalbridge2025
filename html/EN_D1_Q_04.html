      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how artificial intelligence increases the value of digital public infrastructure when interoperable building blocks, a robust legal framework, and sustainable financing are in place. Practices from Kyrgyzstan (Тундук), ITU tools and standards, Epsilon 3.ai synthetic data implementations, and the World Bank’s phased approach to moving pilots into production were presented. Key emphases: inclusion and citizen engagement, cybersecurity and data protection, independent audits, and regional cooperation.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Build inclusive and interoperable digital public infrastructure using AI</li>
<li>Strengthen data governance, cybersecurity, and personal data protection to increase trust</li>
<li>Minimize algorithmic bias and ensure transparency and explainability of decisions</li>
<li>Transition AI pilots and sandboxes into sustainable production systems with clear financing</li>
<li>Ensure early and systematic engagement of citizens and civil society in service design</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Which metrics best reflect AI’s real impact for citizens: time, cost, quality, and fairness of access?</li>
<li>How can bias be minimized and explainability and accountability of algorithms in public services be ensured?</li>
<li>Which financing and governance mechanisms enable scaling pilots to production?</li>
<li>How to establish interoperability and data exchange between agencies and countries in the region?</li>
<li>How and at what stage should civil society be involved in developing DPI to increase adoption and trust?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Kyrgyzstan: the «Тундук» platform connected 80+ government bodies and ~300 organizations; more than 80% of public services are digitized; transaction volume is about one billion per year with a population of 7.3 million, which led to debureaucratization, reduced corruption, and time savings.</li>
<li>AI in DPI enhances big data analytics, personalization, and automation, but requires explainability of decisions and built-in algorithmic fairness.</li>
<li>Citizen trust is impossible without cybersecurity and personal data protection; independent third-party audits improve quality and accountability.</li>
<li>ITU promotes a neutral, public-good-oriented approach to AI through the AI for Good platform and multistakeholder standards, emphasizing the reduction of the digital divide.</li>
<li>To reduce bias in national language models, it is necessary to include data from rural regions, dialects, and diverse communities.</li>
<li>Epsilon 3.ai uses synthetic data (ZGANN technology) to model rare/crisis scenarios; cases in energy (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan) achieved forecast accuracy >99% and enabled operation under data shortages and gaps.</li>
<li>The World Bank recommends a phased (staged) approach: diagnostics (AI Readiness, ICT Core Gov Assessment), then implementation, training, and monitoring, taking into account the country’s maturity (from classical methods to ML/LLM).</li>
<li>Key challenges: data governance and privacy, interoperability (basic standards and agreements are needed), equal access and service accessibility.</li>
<li>Leading practices (Estonia, Singapore): one-stop shop, advanced citizen e-participation, strong leadership and financing, which accelerates the adoption of digital services.</li>
<li>International cooperation, open standards, and open source simplify data exchange and strengthen inter-country trust in the region.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Without confidence in security, there is no trust.” — <span class="author">Adilet Zhumayeva</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We would like to see artificial intelligence as a tool that creates public good and makes it possible to reduce the digital divide.” — <span class="author">Farid Nakhli</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI is a decision-making tool that is still in an infant state — I would hope that the hype meets the reality.” — <span class="author">Richard Kerby</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“If you don't use third-party audits, you're basically auditing yourself.” — <span class="author">Richard Kerby</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI and DPI can be hope or fear — it depends on how you deal with this technology.” — <span class="author">Charlz Blanko</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Responsible AI deployment in DPI requires strong government leadership, transparent data governance, independent audits, and early citizen engagement.</li>
<li>Interoperability and open standards are the foundation for scalability and cross-country data exchange; financing should combine public funds, partnerships, and innovative mechanisms.</li>
<li>Synthetic data and a phased implementation strategy help overcome the shortage of quality data and move pilots into production.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Support the principle of early involvement of citizens and civil society in the design and testing of digital public services.</li>
<li>Recommend conducting regular independent (third-party) audits of security, privacy, and algorithm quality.</li>
<li>Adopt a phased approach to implementing AI in DPI (from diagnostics to scaling) with a priority on training and knowledge transfer.</li>
<li>Develop regional agreements on interoperability and data exchange based on open standards.</li>
<li>Use sandboxes and synthetic data to safely rehearse high-risk scenarios before scaling.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Create an interagency working group on AI/DPI to develop a unified framework for data governance, privacy, and ethics.</li>
<li>Conduct an AI Readiness and digital maturity assessment (e.g., using World Bank/GTMI tools) to prioritize projects.</li>
<li>Launch a program of independent audits of algorithms and infrastructure, including checks for bias and explainability.</li>
<li>Organize the collection and expansion of training datasets with participation from regions and dialects (including rural areas) to reduce algorithmic bias.</li>
<li>Develop a roadmap for moving pilots from sandboxes to production systems, indicating sources of financing and impact metrics.</li>
<li>Develop and implement a mechanism for continuous citizen feedback (e-participation) on a 'one-stop shop' basis.</li></ul>
