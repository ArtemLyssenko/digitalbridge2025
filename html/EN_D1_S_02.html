      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>Lily Liu presented Solana's vision as a global internet layer for capital markets, where tokens provide 24/7 access to liquidity for everyone. She highlighted the structural problems of traditional markets: privatization of gains and socialization of losses, rising barriers to entry, and the lengthening of companies' private phase. Blockchain is framed as a "universal basic opportunity": data becomes money, which lowers thresholds for investors and issuers around the world, including Kazakhstan.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show why Solana's speed and low transaction cost are strategically important for financial markets.</li>
<li>Justify blockchain as a mechanism for lowering barriers for investors and issuers at a global level.</li>
<li>Position Solana as the internet layer for direct listing and trading of tokenized assets.</li>
<li>Build understanding of 24/7 capital market access through wallets and tokens.</li>
<li>Stimulate interest from countries and companies (including Kazakhstan) in issuing and listing assets on the Solana network.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to lower barriers to entry to capital markets for retail investors around the world?</li>
<li>How does blockchain turn data into money and create a 'universal basic opportunity' instead of a universal basic income?</li>
<li>How to give issuers (including SMEs and companies from emerging markets) direct access to global liquidity?</li>
<li>Why do traditional markets increasingly concentrate returns in the private phase, and how can this be countered?</li>
<li>How can Solana become a standard infrastructure layer embedded in browsers and mobile devices?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Solana processes more transactions than all other blockchains combined and was originally built as a global financial system.</li>
<li>Traditional capital markets have shifted: companies stay private longer, which pushes financial freedom further away for the majority and concentrates returns among the few.</li>
<li>The 2008 crisis and the subsequent 'bailout' demonstrated the privatization of gains and the socialization of losses amid rising public debt and service costs.</li>
<li>Concentration of returns in the S&P 500: a few of the largest technology companies make up a significant share of the index, and 'alternative' assets are no longer alternative.</li>
<li>On the buy side, blockchain simplifies access: a wallet is created in a minute, after which stablecoins, memecoins, and a wide range of tokenized assets are available.</li>
<li>On the sell side, traditional listing is expensive (on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees) and concentrated in the US; competing with NYSE/NASDAQ is difficult.</li>
<li>Internet markets on blockchain operate 24/7 with a global distribution network: today around 200 million participants, with a potential of 5.5 billion internet users.</li>
<li>Solana seeks to become the 'internet layer' for capital markets, enabling direct asset listing and seamless operation from browsers and mobile apps.</li>
<li>For Kazakhstan and other emerging markets, this is a chance to access deep global liquidity beyond local exchanges (e.g., AIFC) and to tokenize real assets (including mining assets).</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We process more transactions in the world than all other blockchain companies combined.” — <span class="author">Lily Liu</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“With blockchain, data becomes money, and money becomes data.” — <span class="author">Lily Liu</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Solana will be that layer on the internet for financial capital markets.” — <span class="author">Lily Liu</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Gains are privatized now, and losses are socialized.” — <span class="author">Lily Liu</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Blockchain technologies, and Solana in particular, can radically lower barriers in capital markets for investors and issuers.</li>
<li>The model of direct listing and asset tokenization opens up 24/7 global liquidity, which is especially important for developing economies.</li>
<li>Shifting from UBI to a 'universal basic opportunity' via open networks provides more sustainable economic inclusion than redistribution.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Focus on developing Solana as the foundational internet layer for financial markets and direct listings.</li>
<li>Continue simplifying the wallet user experience and access to a variety of tokenized assets via browser and mobile devices.</li>
<li>Expand global distribution reach, aiming to grow the audience from hundreds of millions to billions of users.</li>
<li>Support use cases for real-world sectors (including mining companies in Kazakhstan) to access global liquidity through tokenization.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Launch tokenization pilot projects for companies from Kazakhstan (e.g., the mining sector), followed by direct listing on the Solana network.</li>
<li>Organize educational sessions on creating wallets, working with stablecoins, and key management for new market participants.</li>
<li>Form partnerships with local exchanges and fintech ecosystems (including AIFC) for issuer onboarding and integration of on/off-ramp solutions.</li>
<li>Prepare methodological materials on the legal and technical aspects of token issuance for SMEs and corporate issuers.</li>
<li>Expand the tooling infrastructure (SDK, API) for simple direct listing and token management from the web and mobile apps.</li>
<li>Conduct analysis and engagement with regulators on KYC/AML compliance within open blockchain markets.</li></ul>

      <h2>Sources</h2>
      <ul><li>S&P 500 and concentration of market capitalization in the largest technology companies</li>
<li>The 2008 crisis and the bailout package (~$780 billion)</li>

<li>Regional initiative to launch an exchange in Texas</li>
<li>AIFC (AIX) — an exchange in Kazakhstan</li>
