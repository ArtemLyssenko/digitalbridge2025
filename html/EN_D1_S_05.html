    <h1>Digital Transformation of Kyrgyzstan: Tunduk, the Digital Code, AI, and Interagency Interaction</h1>

    <div class="speakers">
      
  <div class="speaker-badge">
    <div>
      <span class="speaker-name">Minister of Digital Development of the Kyrgyz Republic (name not specified)</span>
      <span class="speaker-role"> — Government of the Kyrgyz Republic</span>
    </div>
  </div>

    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The Minister presented the practical results of Kyrgyzstan’s digital transformation: the Tunduk eGov mobile application with 19 legally significant digital documents; the launch of an end-to-end digital birth registration service with interagency integration and subsequent medical services; the adoption of the Digital Code, which consolidated regulation of the internet, AI, and satellite communications and strengthened the protection of children’s data; the development of the AI ecosystem (Kyrgyz language model, supercomputers, data centers powered by “green” energy) and a strict shift to paperless public services through the interagency interaction system.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Share the experience and practices of digital public services of the Kyrgyz Republic</li>
<li>Provide legal certainty for businesses and citizens through the Digital Code</li>
<li>Accelerate the transition to a digital-first model and the phase-out of paper documents</li>
<li>Develop infrastructure for AI (language model, supercomputers, data centers) based on “green” energy</li>
<li>Attract investors to the country’s digital infrastructure</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to scale interagency integrations so that services become truly end-to-end?</li>
<li>What power capacities and financing models are needed for the sustainable development of data centers and supercomputers?</li>
<li>How to ensure the protection of children’s personal data and consent mechanisms in digital services?</li>
<li>What measures will ensure discipline among government agencies during the transition to paperless service?</li>
<li>How to support the private sector in developing and deploying AI models in the Kyrgyz language?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The Tunduk application contains 19 digital documents (from an ID card to an OSAGO policy), recognized by law as digital-first.</li>
<li>The digital birth registration service is integrated with multiple agencies and automates the routing of medical services (vaccination, etc.).</li>
<li>The Digital Code of the Kyrgyz Republic has been adopted, unifying about 5 laws and ~100 subordinate acts; it covers the internet, AI, satellite communications, and data protection.</li>
<li>For the first time, the concept of “child’s personal data” and mechanisms of anonymized consent for services for children have been established.</li>
<li>The document received a positive assessment from the UN, strengthening the confidence of investors and partners.</li>
<li>A Kyrgyz language model has been developed and is being enriched; the state supports private-sector AI initiatives.</li>
<li>Supercomputers are being deployed with access for government agencies and businesses; additional procurements are planned.</li>
<li>Kyrgyzstan relies on water resources and “green” energy to power data centers and HPC infrastructure.</li>
<li>A decree has been adopted: government agencies are not entitled to require paper documents; confirmation is through the application and interagency data exchange.</li>
<li>The interagency interaction system enables agencies to obtain the necessary data on their own without citizens’ participation.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The legal and technological foundations for a digital state in Kyrgyzstan have been created and are receiving international recognition.</li>
<li>The transition to paperless services and the development of AI infrastructure require interagency discipline and investment, but are already delivering tangible benefits for citizens.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>The Digital Code of the Kyrgyz Republic has been adopted as a single regulatory act in the digital sphere.</li>
<li>An end-to-end digital birth registration service with interagency integration has been introduced.</li>
<li>A government decree has been adopted prohibiting the demand for paper documents from citizens.</li>
<li>Supercomputers have been launched, and their capacity is planned to be expanded for government entities and businesses.</li>
<li>A Kyrgyz language model has been developed and is being rolled out to support AI solutions.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Procure additional supercomputers and ensure access to them for government agencies and private companies.</li>
<li>Expand the list of digital documents and functions in the Tunduk application.</li>
<li>Deepen the data corpus and quality of the Kyrgyz language model (including historical sources).</li>
<li>Attract investment in data centers powered by “green” energy and ensure reliable power supply.</li>
<li>Fine-tune compliance control for the “no paper” policy and train front-office staff.</li>
<li>Scale interagency integrations and develop proactive public services (for example, vaccination).</li></ul>
