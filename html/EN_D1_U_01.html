      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed AI as a new “language of diplomacy” and a trust mechanism among the state, business, and communities. Kazakhstan showcased leadership: an AI law, a national data/model platform, supercomputers, a new sectoral ministerial mandate, and a plan for an AI university. Business called for practical implementation through existing networks and reducing regulatory uncertainty, while CA IT parks urged a shift from promotion to joint technology projects (water, local languages). Communities (Women in Tech) and the financial sector proposed scalable training programs and ethical “human-in-the-loop” solutions.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Define the role of parliament and state institutions in supporting international cooperation and public trust during AI implementation</li>
<li>Develop practical mechanisms for cross-country technological cooperation among Central Asian IT parks</li>
<li>Increase business readiness for AI adoption through industry networks and clear, soft regulation</li>
<li>Build sustainable mass AI literacy programs (especially in regions) and community engagement</li>
<li>Align ethical principles and a human‑in‑the‑loop approach for critical domains (fintech, healthcare, public services)</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What role should parliament and government bodies play in international AI cooperation and building public trust?</li>
<li>How ready is business to adopt AI, and which risks/barriers require priority removal?</li>
<li>How can we move from joint exhibitions to real inter-park technology projects between the region’s countries?</li>
<li>How can communities (e.g., Women in Tech) accelerate the export/import of knowledge and the region’s global presence?</li>
<li>Which training approaches are effective for regions with low baseline digital literacy?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI is positioned as a new tool of diplomacy: it affects negotiations, cooperation, and trust among the state, business, and society.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan is among the few countries with a separate AI law; according to Stanford — in the top 15 by the speed of regulatory adaptation.</li>
<li>Infrastructure foundations are being created: supercomputers, a national platform for datasets and training industry models, a new line agency (a minister at the rank of deputy prime minister), and a plan for an AI university.</li>
<li>The key idea of the law is balance: protect citizens’ rights without slowing technological development; soft regulation for low/medium risk, strict regulation for high risk.</li>
<li>Business insists on practicality: don’t reinvent the wheel; adapt ready-made solutions and use existing broad networks of integrators for scaling.</li>
<li>The Kyrgyz IT Park is developing an AI Academy and a community of 2000+ members, piloting a Kyrgyz-language voice assistant and proposing cross-country AI projects (water resource management).</li>
<li>Communities (Women in Tech) strengthen international presence, launch free courses (AI for Her), and are preparing a women’s venture fund to support startups.</li>
<li>The financial sector is the frontline of adoption: an AI anti-fraud case with mandatory human‑in‑the‑loop; banks help SMEs adopt AI tools.</li>
<li>Education is shifting to continuous upskilling: reskilling every 2 years; for mass regional reach — mobile‑first and gamification.</li>
<li>The trust gap and digital divide remain threats; communication, accessible training, and visible industry pilots are the main drivers of adoption.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“The main goal of the law is to protect citizens’ rights and, most importantly, not hinder the development of technologies.” — <span class="author">Ekaterina Smolyakova</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The main thing is not to reinvent the wheel. Let’s implement what already exists.” — <span class="author">Irina Sulimenko</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Artificial intelligence is not tomorrow, but today.” — <span class="author">Chubak Temirov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Digital diplomacy is about people.” — <span class="author">Asem Bolatzhan</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We need to go to phones from a gamification standpoint.” — <span class="author">Chubak Temirov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The region needs to shift from promo activities to joint technology projects on shared infrastructure and principles of trust and ethics.</li>
<li>A combination of soft regulation, industry pilots, and integrator networks is the fastest path to scaling AI in the economy.</li>
<li>Communities and the financial sector close critical gaps: mass AI literacy, access to global markets, and practical cases with human‑in‑the‑loop.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Initiate an official letter of recommendations from Women in Tech to the government based on the session’s outcomes.</li>
<li>Form a cross-country working group of Central Asian IT parks for joint AI pilots (priority — water resource management).</li>
<li>Scale the free AI for Her course as a regional standard of basic AI literacy (including for men).</li>
<li>Use existing industry networks of integrators (e.g., 1С) as channels for rapid AI adoption in business.</li>
<li>Adhere to a soft regulation model for low/medium risk and human‑in‑the‑loop in critical domains (fintech, healthcare).</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Prepare and submit to the government a package of recommendations: inter-park cooperation, dataset sharing, ethical frameworks, and training programs.</li>
<li>Launch a pilot cross-country AI project on water resources (Kazakhstan–Kyrgyzstan–Uzbekistan–Tajikistan) with shared metrics and data.</li>
<li>Create a catalog of existing integrator and implementer networks by industry and agree on AI implementation roadmaps with them.</li>
<li>Deploy a regional online AI learning platform (AI for Her) with mobile access and gamification to reach the regions.</li>
<li>Organize series of industry trust pilots (anti-fraud, healthcare diagnostics, EdTech) with public reporting on metrics and risks.</li>
<li>Form a communications campaign on AI ethics and protection of citizens’ rights, including explanation of regulation and human‑in‑the‑loop mechanics.</li></ul>
