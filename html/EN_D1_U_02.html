      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed the role of the state as the architect of trust in AI, the balance between innovation and the protection of citizens’ rights, as well as practical mechanisms for implementing AI in the public sector. Experts emphasized the importance of data quality, audits, and open standards, as well as the development of infrastructure (green/hybrid data centers). Special emphasis was placed on the human factor: the cognitive effects of interaction with AI and the need for responsible, human-centered system design.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Define the role of the state as the architect of trust and regulator of unified rules for the use of AI</li>
<li>Balance accelerated AI deployment with the protection of human rights, transparency, and fairness</li>
<li>Build a sustainable data and compute infrastructure (including green and hybrid data centers)</li>
<li>Develop human capital and multidisciplinary teams for the AI-driven transformation of the public sector</li>
<li>Advance international cooperation and joint research initiatives in the field of responsible AI</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How can we strike a balance between rapid AI development and the protection of citizens’ rights and democratic values?</li>
<li>What unified data standards, audit mechanisms, and impact assessments should be applied to AI in the public sector?</li>
<li>What role do green and hybrid data centers play in the competitiveness of Eurasia’s digital economies?</li>
<li>How should cognitive effects and users’ behavioral biases be taken into account when designing human-centered AI systems?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI is not a subject of law; liability lies with natural and legal persons, and this must be clearly enshrined in legislation.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan has advanced in e-government (high UN ranking), but holds mid-tier positions on AI development indicators; a strengthened regulatory and institutional response is needed.</li>
<li>The state should act as the architect of trust: set unified rules, data standards, and processes for regular audits of AI decisions.</li>
<li>Without high-quality and harmonized data, the “garbage in — garbage out” effect undermines algorithm reliability and trust.</li>
<li>Cross-sector pilots, sandboxes, and public–private partnerships accelerate deployment, enabling testing and scaling of successful cases.</li>
<li>Green and hybrid data centers are critical infrastructure for AI and the “digital bridge” of Eurasia; AI will become the brain of the green economy.</li>
<li>In the public sector, the roles of Chief AI Officer and AI leads in agencies are important, as are programs to train AI Ambassadors.</li>
<li>The human factor: AI amplifies cognitive offloading and can lead to cognitive atrophy; there is a tendency to be swayed by AI’s “confident tone.”</li>
<li>It is necessary to restrict high-risk practices of manipulating emotions and cognitive biases, while advancing transparency (from “black box” to “white box”).</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Whatever technologies we use and develop, human rights and the interests of citizens must always remain at the center.” — <span class="author">Bakyt Zheksembai</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Artificial intelligence is not a subject of law.” — <span class="author">Sholpan Saimova</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The state should act as the architect of trust and set clear rules of the game.” — <span class="author">Evgeny Khokhlunov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Eurasia stands at the crossroads of East and West. By investing in green data centers, we are creating a digital bridge.” — <span class="author">Erdem Erkul</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI is not just a technology; it requires people, processes, and data.” — <span class="author">Se-Hyeon Cho</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI amplifies cognitive offloading but carries the risk of cognitive atrophy.” — <span class="author">Alina Gutoreva</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Without the systemic role of the state as the architect of trust, AI implementation risks becoming fragmented and contradictory.</li>
<li>Legal foundations (Digital Code, AI law) should enshrine responsibility, rights protection, and transparency without stalling innovation.</li>
<li>Data quality, auditing, and open standards are the foundation of reliable and fair AI solutions.</li>
<li>Infrastructure (green/hybrid data centers) and talent programs are key to the region’s long-term competitiveness.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Support the development and public discussion of the Digital Code and AI law in Kazakhstan, enshrining the principle that AI is not a subject of law.</li>
<li>Introduce regular auditing of algorithms and data in the public sector with the participation of external experts and civil society.</li>
<li>Create and expand regulatory sandboxes for public–private AI pilots with subsequent scaling of successful cases.</li>
<li>Initiate a program to develop green and hybrid data centers as pillars of the digital economy in Central Asia.</li>
<li>Appoint AI leads (Chief AI Officer) in executive authorities and form a network of AI Ambassadors in agencies.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Form an interdepartmental working group to prepare the Digital Code and AI law; launch a cycle of public consultations.</li>
<li>Develop unified data standards and methodologies for independent auditing and AI impact assessment for the public sector.</li>
<li>Conduct diagnostics of key government processes to determine priority AI pilots and data requirements.</li>
<li>Launch a training program for civil servants (AI literacy, risk management, responsible AI) and train AI Ambassadors.</li>
<li>Prepare a feasibility study and a roadmap for creating green/hybrid data centers in the region with a focus on energy efficiency.</li>
<li>Establish an inter-university laboratory for human-centered AI and the cognitive effects of interaction with AI; start joint research.</li>
<li>Deploy a Center for Technologies for Society in partnership with industry to support NGOs and AI research projects.</li>
<li>Create a catalog of AI applications in government agencies (use-case library) and a system for sharing best practices.</li></ul>
