      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session showed how mobile data and AI are moving from pilots to institutional use in public administration. Kazakhstan presented legal changes and a tourism pilot where mobile data radically broaden coverage compared with traditional statistics. The World Bank described the global GDF/MPD program and countries’ path from pilots to sustainable data pipelines. Positium demonstrated practical cases for transport and social infrastructure; Kazakh Tourism outlined operational benefits for planning and investment.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Institutionalize the use of mobile data in official statistics and policy</li>
<li>Establish sustainable legal, organizational, and technical foundations for access to anonymized positioning data</li>
<li>Scale use cases beyond tourism (migration, transport, social protection, emergencies)</li>
<li>Ensure a balance between privacy and utility through standards, anonymization, and work with regulators</li>
<li>Build national capabilities (workforce, infrastructure, methodology) and public-private partnerships</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How is Kazakhstan’s Bureau of National Statistics integrating alternative sources, including mobile data, into official statistics?</li>
<li>What is the World Bank’s GDF/MPD program, how is it structured, and which countries participate in it?</li>
<li>Which proven mobile data use cases worldwide can be scaled in Kazakhstan?</li>
<li>What technical and administrative steps are needed for sustainable delivery of mobile-data-based products?</li>
<li>What risks and challenges (legal, privacy, data access, standards) arise, and how can they be minimized?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Kazakhstan carried out a digital transformation of national statistics and established a legal basis: amendments to the Law on State Statistics (2023) and to the Law 'On Communications' (27 September of the current year) to enable access to anonymized positioning data for statistical purposes.</li>
<li>The tourism pilot (БНС + Positium with support from the World Bank) showed that mobile data capture 107.6 million domestic trips versus 7.8 million officially recorded stays — 14 times more.</li>
<li>Seasonality and peaks of tourist load are visible at the level of days and hours (July–August, December, March, May), enabling rapid responses to fluctuations and incidents (e.g., floods).</li>
<li>Е-Қонақ covers only visitors registered in СМР and does not capture short visits and within-country movements; mobile data account for self-organized tourists and indirect demand.</li>
<li>БНС plans, starting next year, to receive full data from all three mobile operators, develop extraction rules, and introduce МД-based indicators into official statistics.</li>
<li>GDF/MPD builds two-year programmatic support: coordination with regulators and operators, training, UN/ITU methodologies, transition from pilots to sustainable pipelines and multiple use cases.</li>
<li>Mobile data complement surveys: big data increase the value of sample surveys, and surveys calibrate and reduce biases in big data.</li>
<li>Practical benefits: planning transport and social services (Positium cases: route redesign in Tartu delivered +20% ridership with the same budget), road infrastructure management based on traffic.</li>
<li>For privacy, anonymization, aggregation, and engagement with data-protection regulators are mandatory; standards and agreements (MoU, SLA, licenses) are being established.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Kazakhstan became the first country in the CIS to implement mobile data in tourism statistics.” — <span class="author">Maksat Turlubaev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Big data increases the value of survey data.” — <span class="author">Trevor Monroe</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Where we want to go from here is really to institutionalize the use of this data, not just have one-off projects.” — <span class="author">Trevor Monroe</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The ridership has increased by 20%.” — <span class="author">Gerttu Pilsas</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Where are the other nine million?” — <span class="author">Daniel Serzhanuly</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“This is a step into the future, where information becomes the foundation of effective public administration.” — <span class="author">Maksat Turlubaev</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Mobile data radically increase completeness, timeliness, and granularity of indicators on tourism, migration, and population mobility.</li>
<li>Sustainable use of МД requires a legal framework, privacy standards, interagency governance, and technological pipelines.</li>
<li>Integration of big data and sample surveys yields more accurate and cost-efficient statistics than each source alone.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Starting next year, БНС will begin receiving full anonymized positioning data from all three mobile operators.</li>
<li>Develop and approve rules for extracting and using mobile data for statistical purposes at the national level.</li>
<li>Implement the pilot results into official tourism statistics and expand their application to migration and transport indicators.</li>
<li>Continue partnership with the World Bank and Positium for methodological and technological support.</li>
<li>Prepare methodological frameworks that allow МНO to legally monetize aggregated analytics for business while keeping macro-level statistics free of charge.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Finalize MoU and SLA with all МНO, including regulations for anonymization, aggregation, and data transmission frequency.</li>
<li>Develop and publish a national methodology on МД in tourism, migration, and mobility in line with UNWTO and ITU recommendations.</li>
<li>Deploy secure processing infrastructure (DPI, ETL pipelines, quality control, privacy audit) at БНС.</li>
<li>Provide training for specialists of БНС and sectoral agencies on tools and interpretation of МД (including GDF/MPD courses).</li>
<li>Create dashboards for real-time monitoring of tourist flows and seasonal load on regional infrastructure.</li>
<li>Launch pilots on migration and transport (OD matrices, traffic by road segments) with integration of administrative and sensor data.</li>
<li>Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) jointly with regulators and approve procedures for responding to risks.</li></ul>
