      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session focused on a large-scale reform of digital asset regulation in Kazakhstan (a new taxonomy, liberalization of onshore circulation and integration with ТФИ), the launch and use cases of stablecoins (including a KZT stablecoin and the CNY AX stablecoin) for cross-border payments, the creation of a state crypto reserve and the concept of Криптогород Алатау, as well as the balance between innovation and compliance to attract foreign investment.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Outline the framework of a comprehensive reform of digital asset regulation and tokenization in РК</li>
<li>Show practical stablecoin use cases for B2B and cross-border payments</li>
<li>Clarify the parameters of the state crypto reserve and launch timelines</li>
<li>Present the concept of Криптогород Алатау as a liberal jurisdiction for the crypto industry</li>
<li>Discuss the approach to compliance and integration with the traditional financial infrastructure</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>When and in what form will crypto assets be available to the general public in Kazakhstan while preserving the tenge as the sole legal tender?</li>
<li>Can stablecoins replace SWIFT for cross-border payments and under what conditions?</li>
<li>What amendments to the Law on Digital Assets and related acts are planned by the end of the year?</li>
<li>How to ensure a balance between the liberal regime in Криптогород and AML/sanctions compliance requirements?</li>
<li>What opportunities will Криптогород and tokenization create for foreign investors (FDI) and retail participants?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The National Bank is preparing an updated taxonomy of digital assets: KZT-backed stablecoins, tokenized national assets and real-world assets (RWA), with the liberalization of onshore circulation and new channels of integration with ТФИ.</li>
<li>Regulatory sandbox: 8 projects already approved; about 15 are planned to launch by the end of the year; the first product is a KZT stablecoin with the participation of Евразийского банка for online transactions and later for cross-border payments.</li>
<li>Additional projects announced: stablecoins (including from Binance and local fintech), tokenization of real estate and equity, tests for OTC operations and conversions.</li>
<li>The state crypto reserve will be managed by the National Investment Corporation of НБ РК, investment activity start — January 2026; the strategy is a diversified portfolio (crypto assets, derivatives, ETFs, stakes in global crypto companies), not a “buy and hold” of only bitcoin.</li>
<li>Криптоград Алатау will receive a special legal regime and more liberal rules for crypto and related innovations (drones, autonomous transport, etc.) to become a magnet for FDI.</li>
<li>Principled position of НБ РК: the tenge remains the only legal currency; crypto payments are via stablecoins denominated/redeemed in tenge.</li>
<li>Stablecoins already demonstrate an advantage over SWIFT in speed (≈instant versus T+3–5), while challenges remain with on- and off-ramp liquidity and bank acceptance; a T+1 conversion regime has been promised.</li>
<li>The key challenge is compliance and the “operating system” for AML/KYC/sanctions; increased automation and smart‑contract checks are expected to reduce the total cost of compliance.</li>
<li>The Big One exchange is strengthening compliance with AFSA/МФЦА requirements, cooperating with the Ministry of Finance and card schemes, building liquidity and incident response with a priority on client protection.</li>
<li>Tokenization of natural resources and real estate in РК can unlock mass co-investment (small-denomination shares), accelerate settlements and reduce costs for trade and e-commerce.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Our core values are trust and reliability: even after a hack we guaranteed clients 100% of funds.” — <span class="author">Afina Myao</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Kazakhstan is accelerating toward the role of a Eurasian crypto hub through a comprehensive regulatory reform, a sandbox, and institutional projects (crypto reserve).</li>
<li>Stablecoins are becoming a practical channel for cross-border payments; automated compliance and integration with ТФИ are critical for scaling.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Principle confirmed: the tenge remains the sole legal means of payment; crypto use is via KZT stablecoins.</li>
<li>Agreed to advance a package of 100+ amendments to the legislation on digital assets with the goal of adoption by year-end.</li>
<li>Expansion of the regulatory sandbox to ~15 projects, including KZT stablecoins and RWA tokenization.</li>
<li>Creation of the state crypto reserve under the management of the National Investment Corporation with the start of investment activity in January 2026.</li>
<li>Refinement of the concept of Криптогород Алатау and the special legal regime with a model to be presented by year-end.</li>
<li>Initiation of cross-border payment pilots in stablecoins with key trading partners (UAE, Turkey) and payment systems.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>The National Bank and the government to submit and pass through Parliament the updated taxonomy of digital assets and the liberalization of onshore circulation.</li>
<li>The National Investment Corporation to prepare the investment mandate, risk policy, and portfolio structure for the state crypto reserve.</li>
<li>AFSA/МФЦА and market participants to launch automation of KYC/AML/sanctions checks and standardize T+1 on-/off‑ramp liquidity.</li>
<li>Launch settlement pilots in stablecoins in cross-border trade (including via Visa/Mastercard and partner banks).</li>
<li>Big One and the Ministry of Finance of РК to deploy joint projects on tokenization of commodities/real estate and retail micro-investments.</li>
<li>Parliament to refine the framework for mining (taxation, social benefits, energy consumption) within the digital code.</li>
<li>The working group of Криптогород Алатау to define the special legal regime, integration with ТФИ, and mechanisms for attracting FDI (including real estate investments via crypto).</li></ul>
