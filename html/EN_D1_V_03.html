      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how AI is changing education: from personalization and shifting the teacher’s role to mentorship to integrating AI into real school processes. Conditions for success were emphasized: combining technology with pedagogical methodology, localization for the Kazakh language and curricula, as well as optimizing cost and infrastructure (including offline modes). Experts called for cautious, metrics-driven scaling through pilots, prioritizing teacher retraining and reducing inequality.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Form a shared vision for applying AI in education and the teacher’s role in the new model</li>
<li>Define priority pilot areas and metrics of their effectiveness</li>
<li>Understand risks: inequality, cognitive debt, excesses of 'overhype,' and cost of ownership</li>
<li>Outline technical approaches to localization (Kazakh language) and cost reduction of solutions</li>
<li>Align steps to prepare teachers and administrators to work with AI</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How will the teacher’s role change with personalized pathways and adaptive learning?</li>
<li>Which real AI cases in schools produce measurable impact, and how should it be measured?</li>
<li>Is AI capable of increasing productivity and employment, or will it displace jobs?</li>
<li>How to ensure AI scaling in the education system considering language, cost, and infrastructure (including offline)?</li>
<li>How to reduce educational inequality and avoid 'overhype' when implementing AI?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI unlocks personalization and adaptive pathways: from a 'class-centric' to a 'learner-centric' model with epistemic maps for each student.</li>
<li>The teacher’s role shifts from a knowledge holder to a mentor, tutor, motivator, and facilitator of team work.</li>
<li>EdTech success with AI requires aligning technology with domain expertise and methodology; 'PDF-ization' is not digitalization.</li>
<li>Simple wins are already available: teacher assistants for routine tasks, content generation, grading, recommendations.</li>
<li>The 'virtual classmate' model (an AI partner) enhances learning through explanation and teaching.</li>
<li>Key reasons for implementation failures: lack of customization to curriculum/language, ignoring adaptive monitoring for teachers/the system, and unaccounted costs (GPU, scale).</li>
<li>Technical paths to cost reduction: LLM distillation and quantization, ensembles of specialized small models, orchestration, semantic caching, federated learning, offline and on-device modes.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan has a consolidation advantage (unified standards/data) and a window of opportunity for localization to the Kazakh language and rapid pilots.</li>
<li>Risks: growth of cognitive debt, increased inequality (urban–rural, language of instruction), overhype, market fragmentation, and dependence on a single vendor.</li>
<li>Objective metrics, cautious scaling through pilots, training of teachers and a community of practice, as well as 'AI-free zones' are needed to foster socialization and reading.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Teachers are losing their monopoly on knowledge; their role is shifting toward motivators, coaches, and tutors.” — <span class="author">Gabit Bekakhmetov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Digitalization is not turning a book into a PDF. It is the digitization of all interactions between teacher and student.” — <span class="author">Zhanadil Taldybayev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI is not only a teacher but also a virtual classmate whom the student can teach.” — <span class="author">Pegor Papazyan</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We are in uncharted waters: this technology cannot be ignored, but we also must not rush.” — <span class="author">Rakhim Oshakbayev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“There is no one-size-fits-all solution: AI in education must be carefully customized to the curriculum, language, and cost of ownership.” — <span class="author">Younes Bensouda Mourri</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI already delivers practical value in teachers’ routine tasks and in personalization, but scaling requires localization to the language/curriculum and rigorous effectiveness evaluation.</li>
<li>Priority goes to training teachers and administrators, creating metrics and safe infrastructure (including offline modes) to reduce inequality and cognitive risks.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan can accelerate through centralized pilots, a registry of vetted solutions, and a program to translate/create high-quality content in the Kazakh language.</li>
<li>A technically resilient path is small and specialized models with orchestration, caching, and federated learning to reduce TCO and dependence on clouds.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Publish and present a foresight report on AI in education and use it as the basis for pilots and metrics.</li>
<li>Expand pilots of AI solutions at 'Келешек мектептері' sites with a focus on teacher assistants and adaptive monitoring.</li>
<li>Launch a mass retraining program for teachers and principals on working with AI, cyber hygiene, and ethics.</li>
<li>Begin forming a state registry of approved EdTech solutions and verification/safety criteria.</li>
<li>Create a localization initiative for AI in the Kazakh language: translation and adaptation of high-quality educational content.</li>
<li>Enshrine the principle of cautious scaling: all implementations go through pilots with objective metrics and feedback.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Define a set of target metrics (achievement, progress along pathways, teacher time savings, engagement, impact on the urban–rural gap).</li>
<li>Form an interagency working group (Ministry of Education, IT companies, educators) for AI customization and data standardization.</li>
<li>Launch a translation/localization program for the Kazakh language with the involvement of teachers and high school students; create open data corpora.</li>
<li>Conduct an open RFP/market scan of EdTech with a series of controlled pilots and public evaluation of results.</li>
<li>Deploy teacher AI assistants for routine tasks (grading, feedback, planning) in pilot schools.</li>
<li>Develop an architecture for low-cost deployments: small models, orchestration, semantic caching, on-device/offline modes, and federated learning.</li>
<li>Create leadership schools for principals and learning circles for innovative teachers to share cases and upskill.</li>
<li>Prepare regulatory requirements for privacy, security, AI ethics, and accessibility for schools.</li>
<li>Test the balance of 'AI-free zones' and digital practices to foster socialization, reading, and teamwork.</li>
<li>Ensure transparent reporting on pilots (dashboard with metrics and external review) and a plan to scale successful solutions.</li></ul>
