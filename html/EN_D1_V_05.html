      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session focuses on how Kazakhstan is turning AI into the core of its education and economic strategy: a National Council on AI has been created and a new AI university announced; the large-scale AISANA program has been launched with hundreds of thousands of students and instructors trained; a partnership with OpenAI has been concluded for a ChatGPT for Education pilot, and a Cardiff campus is opening in Astana. Discussed were the shift from knowledge transmission to mentorship, new assessment models, ethics and critical thinking, as well as industry use cases for AI and the country’s role as a regional hub.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Integrate AI at all levels of education and rethink the teacher’s role as a mentor/coach</li>
<li>Build a national AI ecosystem: an AI university, National Council, infrastructure, and partnerships</li>
<li>Massively raise citizens’ AI literacy and train talent (from users to experts)</li>
<li>Reshape assessment and learning pathways for the AG era (personalization, project-based learning, metacompetencies)</li>
<li>Use AI to accelerate economic growth and position the Republic of Kazakhstan as a regional talent hub</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What path will allow Kazakhstan to maximize the benefits of AI and avoid dependence on 'cognitive superpowers'?</li>
<li>Will AI fundamentally change the nature of university education and assessment?</li>
<li>How can we develop critical thinking and the skill of asking questions among schoolchildren and students in the AI era?</li>
<li>How can knowledge be validated and the risks of hallucinations and unreliable data in AI tools be managed?</li>
<li>How timely is it to scale AI initiatives when current government processes are not fully digitalized?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>A National Council on AI under the President has been created; the first session is dedicated to human capital and education; a new AI university has been announced.</li>
<li>AISANA program: >442,000 students and 55% of the faculty trained; selection of 100,000 students starts in November; assets and source code are planned to be opened to the public.</li>
<li>Partnership with OpenAI: ChatGPT for Education pilot in several universities; a 'Jarvis' for instructors and an AI mentor for students.</li>
<li>Cardiff University opened a campus in Astana: an AI master’s program starting in January, 300 grants annually, and a reskilling center 'From Zero to Hero' (capacity ~2,500/year).</li>
<li>TUMO approach: project-based and applied learning with a 'virtual classmate' (digital twin), where motivation is the main driver.</li>
<li>Assessment needs to be reconsidered: from testing memorization to tasks involving decision-making, generating insights, and using AI with an understanding of its limitations (hallucinations, prompting).</li>
<li>Infrastructure: Kazakhtelecom announced adding almost 2 exaflops; total around 4 exaflops; compute quotas for universities are planned.</li>
<li>Country strategy: build 'network effects' (students, professors, startups, corporations) and link AI R&D to Kazakhstan’s strong assets (agriculture, uranium, logistics, power grid).</li>
<li>BG→AG paradigm shift: from 'learning' to 'mentoring and coaching', developing AI metacompetencies and democratizing AI literacy for all citizens.</li>
<li>Ethics and the human role: a course toward human–AI symbiosis; the teacher transforms into a coach/guide; cultivating the skill of asking high-quality questions is critical.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“AI is a superpower.” — <span class="author">Sayasat Nurbek</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Do not use the word 'learning.' Use the word 'mentorship' and coaching.” — <span class="author">Pol Kim</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Do not be someone’s pawn: borrow from the US and China, but do not become dependent.” — <span class="author">Olaf J. Grot</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We seek a symbiosis of humans and AI, not the removal of humans.” — <span class="author">Olaf J. Grot</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We need to run into this revolution—early adoption will give Kazakhstan a chance to skim the cream.” — <span class="author">Sayasat Nurbek</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Motivation is the gold coin of education.” — <span class="author">Pegor Papazyan</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Kazakhstan is charting a course toward early and large-scale adoption of AI in education, combining international partnerships, infrastructure, and open resources.</li>
<li>Education is shifting from knowledge transmission to mentorship, personalization, and project-based learning; assessment and competencies are being reconsidered for the AG era.</li>
<li>Betting on network effects and tying AI to Kazakhstan’s strong sectors enables the country to aim for a regional hub role without strategic dependence.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Pilot the specialized ChatGPT for Education from OpenAI in a number of Kazakhstani universities.</li>
<li>Open a Cardiff University campus in Astana and launch an AI master’s program starting in January.</li>
<li>Develop the 'From Zero to Hero' reskilling center and expand accessible AI education for citizens.</li>
<li>Allocate compute resource quotas (including Kazakhtelecom capacity) for universities and AISANA projects.</li>
<li>Publicly open the courses, templates, and source code of AISANA to a broad audience (including schoolchildren).</li>
<li>Establish a new university for artificial intelligence and continue the work of the National Council on AI with a focus on education and talent.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Form a working group to update assessment and standards with AI in mind (prompting, validation, anti-hallucination).</li>
<li>Complete certification of the remaining faculty and implement a 'digital Jarvis' for instructors at pilot universities.</li>
<li>Carry out the selection of 100,000 students in November and scale project-based development of AI agents at universities.</li>
<li>Deploy centralized access to supercomputing resources and distribute quotas among universities.</li>
<li>Publish methodological materials on AI mentors and ethics (including the use of digital avatars and consents).</li>
<li>Launch a series of nationwide AI literacy courses for citizens (the 'Elements of AI' model), including schoolchildren.</li>
<li>Align sectoral roadmaps for AI application (agriculture, uranium, logistics, healthcare) with curricula.</li>
<li>Organize recruitment of international students and experts to strengthen network effects in 'Cardiff Kazakhstan' and AISANA.</li></ul>
