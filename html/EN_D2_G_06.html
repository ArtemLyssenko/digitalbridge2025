      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>Hixvel AI — Kazakhstan’s first unicorn — revealed its growth strategy in the AI video market with potential up to a trillion dollars. Aleks Mashrabov explained why he left Snap and turned down acquisition offers, sharing a winner‑takes‑all vision and a plan to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2028. Key risks of competing with Big Tech were discussed, along with a bet on product velocity and a high‑intensity culture. Active hiring in Kazakhstan was announced with competitive stock options and the thesis that the region needs to develop an enterprise‑sales culture.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show Hixvel AI’s strategy in the fast-growing generative video market</li>
<li>Explain the founder’s motivation for repeat entrepreneurship after an exit and corporate role</li>
<li>Break down risks and the competitive landscape (Google/YouTube, ByteDance/TikTok, OpenAI)</li>
<li>Discuss the impact of AI video on marketing and SMBs, and the democratization of creative production</li>
<li>Present the hiring plan and employee motivation (stock options) in Kazakhstan</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Why, after a successful exit and a role at Snap, did you choose the startup path again?</li>
<li>Why did you decline acquisition offers (including talks with Meta), and what was decisive?</li>
<li>What are the main risks for Hixvel AI in a winner‑takes‑all market, and how do you address them?</li>
<li>How will AI video generation change marketing and ad efficiency for businesses (especially SMBs)?</li>
<li>How do you assess Kazakhstan’s IT ecosystem, and what competencies does the region need to develop?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Unique market opportunity: AI‑generated video is already showing higher engagement, and a significant share of social networks’ ad revenue will be directly tied to AI.</li>
<li>Scale vision: capturing ~10% of the aggregate revenue of social networks could enable a $1 trillion market cap; the goal is an accelerated path to $1 billion in revenue by 2028.</li>
<li>Strategy against Big Tech: a bet on daily product improvements, rapid hypothesis testing, and faster understanding of the new industry.</li>
<li>Winner‑takes‑all effect: one dominant player will remain in the niche; it will be extremely difficult for the rest to scale.</li>
<li>Team and culture: main hub in Almaty (63 people) and a team in California (7 people); a high workload of 70–100 hours per week is the norm for growth leaders.</li>
<li>Interest from major players: acquisition offers come in regularly, but the company is "not for sale".</li>
<li>Impact on the advertising market: AI democratizes video production — SMBs will be able to test dozens/hundreds of creatives per day with a single manager.</li>
<li>Market and careers: many new niches will appear (e.g., affordable 3D animation for social networks); by 2028 every second video on social networks may be AI‑generated.</li>
<li>Hiring in Kazakhstan: not only R&D developers are needed, but also finance/legal/back office; stock option packages above the 90th percentile of the regional market.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan’s ecosystem: strong English proficiency and consumer case studies, but a deficit of enterprise‑sales culture for Western markets — this is the key growth area.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We have an opportunity to build a trillion-dollar company.” — <span class="author">Aleks Mashrabov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We are not for sale.” — <span class="author">Aleks Mashrabov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Work mode — at least seventy hours per week.” — <span class="author">Aleks Mashrabov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Every second video on social networks in 2028 will be generated with AI.” — <span class="author">Aleks Mashrabov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The winner takes it all — the winner takes everything.” — <span class="author">Vitalii Volianiuk</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Hixvel AI aims to take a dominant position in AI video, relying on product velocity and deep expertise rather than selling to strategic acquirers.</li>
<li>The social video market is shifting toward AI; this will radically level the playing field for SMBs and change advertising production.</li>
<li>An opportunity window is opening for Kazakhstan: global companies can be built if the enterprise‑sales gap is closed and talent is scaled.</li>
<li>A long‑distance strategy requires high work discipline and strong employee motivation through stock options and participation in the company’s value growth.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Maintain independence and do not consider selling the company, focusing on autonomous growth.</li>
<li>Accelerate product iterations and hypothesis testing to outpace Big Tech.</li>
<li>Focus on advertising and SMB use cases, democratizing the production of video creatives.</li>
<li>Expand the team in Kazakhstan and California, including back office (finance, legal function).</li>
<li>Maintain competitive compensation and a generous stock option program for key employees.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Ramp up recruiting in Almaty: R&D developers, ML/video engineers, as well as finance and legal professionals.</li>
<li>Launch training and graduate hiring programs (incl. NUS/Nazarbayev University) with an emphasis on English and global practices.</li>
<li>Develop and scale tools for rapid A/B testing of video creatives for SMB and performance marketing.</li>
<li>Create an internal track for enterprise sales and business development for Western markets for teams from Kazakhstan.</li>
<li>Expand partnerships with large advertisers/game publishers (e.g., Playrix) for pilots and case studies.</li>
<li>Systematize the internal high‑velocity culture (metrics, weekly experiments, roadmap) while maintaining team sustainability.</li></ul>
