      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>Nik Davydov explained the concept of 'robot communism': AI and big data eliminate the information deficit of a planned economy and improve the allocation of social resources. He noted the explosive progress of AI, practical use cases (robots, new medicines, Perplexity), and at the same time the rise of cyber fraud. The discussion covered new vertical integration in AI stacks, investment priorities (energy, data centers, applications), and Kazakhstan’s path toward sovereign compute and ecosystem growth.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Clarify what is meant by 'robot communism' and how AI is changing resource allocation</li>
<li>Assess the key AI achievements and risks over the past two years</li>
<li>Discuss new business models and vertical integration in the AI industry</li>
<li>Define investment priorities across the stack: energy, chips, clouds, applications</li>
<li>Outline steps to strengthen AI sovereignty and accelerate the development of Kazakhstan’s ecosystem</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What is 'robot communism' and how close are we to it?</li>
<li>Which AI achievements over the past two years have inspired, and which risks and abuses have intensified?</li>
<li>Why are there still few 'ultra-small' billion-dollar companies, and when will they appear?</li>
<li>How are business models changing: from platforms to vertically integrated AI players?</li>
<li>For a country like Kazakhstan, what is the optimal way to invest among energy, chips, clouds, and applications?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI and big data can partially solve the information problem of a planned economy and improve social allocation (example: forecasting demand for medicines based on Kazakhstan’s unified medical data lake).</li>
<li>AI progress is exponential: more happens in weeks than used to happen in months; practical effects are visible in robotics, the discovery of new drugs, and products like Perplexity.</li>
<li>The dark side of AI: the democratization of fraud and cases of social engineering/phishing aided by AI; cybercrime is estimated at about $7 trillion per year.</li>
<li>A new production model: 'it’s not AI replacing people, but people with AI replacing people'; teams shrink to 2–3 people per product, which speeds up the cycle and reduces costs.</li>
<li>The 'Dead Internet' concept: more and more content is created/consumed through AI; the next step is agents interacting with each other on behalf of users.</li>
<li>The AI market is gravitating toward vertical integration (power → chips → clouds → models → applications); the winner is whoever controls the bottleneck or is closer to the user.</li>
<li>Example of NVIDIA: controlling CUDA/GPUs as the bottleneck, moving up the stack to models, clouds, and applications so as not to become a commodity.</li>
<li>Stack-wide investment portfolio: up to 50% in energy and data centers (low risk/high liquidity), the rest in public AI applications and the early-stage application layer; risk of GPU depreciation due to rapidly evolving hardware generations.</li>
<li>For countries: the three pillars of AI are data, compute, and talent; Kazakhstan has advanced: data lakes and GPU clusters have been formed at Kazakhtelecom and the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry.</li>
<li>Strong exits trigger inflows of capital and know-how (Israel’s Unit 8200 experience): stable rules and property protection are critical; venture is a 'canary in the coal mine' for the business climate.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“A planned economy sucks, but AI and big data make it possible to solve its information problem—at least on the social side.” — <span class="author">Nik Davydov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“More has happened in the past two weeks than in the previous two months; the pace is frightening.” — <span class="author">Nik Davydov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“It’s not AI that replaces people, but people with AI who replace people.” — <span class="author">Nik Davydov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“A country without its own GPU compute is like a country without a nuclear arsenal.” — <span class="author">Nik Davydov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Venture capitalists are like a canary in a mine: if the canary drops, it means there’s not much oxygen.” — <span class="author">Nik Davydov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI makes it possible to partially implement more efficient social allocation of resources and changes production models by shrinking teams and speeding up product launches.</li>
<li>Cyber risks are growing alongside AI capabilities; stronger cyber hygiene and infrastructure protection are required.</li>
<li>Vertical integration in the AI stack and control of bottlenecks (GPUs, distribution) determine the new market leaders.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan is moving in the right direction: data, GPU clusters, and talent create the foundation of AI sovereignty and will attract international capital if stable rules of the game are maintained.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Support and scale national GPU clusters and data lakes as the foundation of AI sovereignty.</li>
<li>Treat the development of energy and data centers as a strategic priority for participating in the global AI race.</li>
<li>Focus support programs on AI-native teams and repeat founders, accelerating their entry into global markets.</li>
<li>Strengthen cybersecurity measures and training against social engineering and AI-enabled fraud at the ecosystem level.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Audit current compute capacity (GPUs) and approve a plan to expand data centers and energy capacity for AI workloads.</li>
<li>Launch targeted incentives (incentives/PPAs/capex support) for new data centers and renewable generation tied to AI workloads.</li>
<li>Create a grant-and-investment program for the application layer (agents, vertical solutions) with a mandatory go-to-market in the US/EU.</li>
<li>Organize an industry cyber-resilience program: anti-phishing/social engineering trainings, bug bounty, and SOC-sharing for startups.</li>
<li>Conclude partnerships with leading players (NVIDIA, hyperscalers) to access modern GPUs, models, and robotics tools.</li>
<li>Develop a track for repeat founders: fast checks, international sales accelerators, mentorship, and legal support for redomiciliation.</li></ul>
