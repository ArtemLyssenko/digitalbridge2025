      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed why the US leads the global AI ecosystem: the role of the state and Silicon Valley culture, market and capital readiness. The speakers unpacked the “day zero” for immigrant founders, approaches to networking and GTM in the AI era. HP’s corporate venture showed strategy and programs, as well as the impact of AI on productivity and jobs. A separate segment was devoted to the role of the diaspora and expanding the participation of women founders.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Understand the factors behind US leadership in AI and the implications for global startups</li>
<li>Determine practical steps for founders from Central Asia to scale in the US</li>
<li>Show the role of corporate venture and training programs in accelerating AI adoption</li>
<li>Formulate an approach to product marketing and sales amid the AI boom</li>
<li>Discuss ways to increase women's participation in tech entrepreneurship</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Why is the US the leader of the global AI ecosystem, and how is Silicon Valley culture different?</li>
<li>Where should an immigrant founder start in the US: networking, team, first customers?</li>
<li>Can founders from Central Asia successfully compete in the US market, and thanks to what?</li>
<li>How are product marketing and GTM changing in the AI era, and which tools work?</li>
<li>How do corporations (using HP as an example) support AI startups, and what is being done to engage women founders?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Historically, the state created the conditions for technological breakouts in the US; today the culture of innovation is sustained by capital, the immigrant environment, and a readiness to take risks.</li>
<li>AI is, for the first time, automating white-collar work at scale, and the cloud has removed barriers to entry: you need a brain and a computer, not a factory.</li>
<li>In Central Asia there is a gap in access to capital and corporate readiness; in the US, mature customers buy faster and create a flywheel of reinvestment through M&A and IPOs.</li>
<li>Effective networking is value-driven exchange: give many times, then ask; it is built on intros and usefulness, not on business cards.</li>
<li>Immigrant drive and work ethic (the notional “9-9-6/7”) shape execution speed; in Europe and some countries the motivational environment is weaker.</li>
<li>A competitiveness strategy for founders from the region: choose problems relevant to the US, partner with local experts, and go door to door for your first customers.</li>
<li>Product marketing in the AI era requires clear positioning, mapping your ICP, and coherent storytelling about value over a 10-year horizon, not just hype.</li>
<li>Corporate venture (as exemplified by HP) accelerates strategic growth, opens future markets, and saves customers millions (an example of a startup that cut LLM costs by about half).</li>
<li>The RISKS of job displacement are offset by upskilling/reskilling: AI PCs, built-in AI features, incubators, and educational programs (HP Life, HP Garage).</li>
<li>Gender equality is a strategic priority: there are programs and partnerships (AmCham, UN agencies); it is important for women founders to boost confidence in pitches — the data show high ROI.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“In the US it’s not 'risk capital' but venture — a journey; AI is becoming an equalizer around the world.” — <span class="author">Galym Imanbayev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Networking is not collecting business cards; give ten times, ask once.” — <span class="author">Nik Davydov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“According to Goldman Sachs, AI could add about seven trillion to global GDP; Kazakhstan’s potential is plus 2% over ten years.” — <span class="author">Diana Raian</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“You don’t want to compete head-on — play your cards so that you inevitably win.” — <span class="author">Ulvi Rashid</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“I invest in two things: big markets and hungry immigrants.” — <span class="author">Galym Imanbayev</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The US maintains leadership in AI thanks to a combination of state foundations, a culture of risk, capital, and customer readiness.</li>
<li>Founders from Central Asia can successfully compete in the US if they focus on relevant problems, build strong networks, and position themselves correctly.</li>
<li>Corporate venture and educational initiatives accelerate AI adoption and mitigate the risks of job displacement through large-scale upskilling.</li>
<li>Expanding women’s participation in tech entrepreneurship is a condition for sustainable ecosystem growth and improved capital efficiency.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>The speakers confirmed their readiness to mentor and make intros for founders from Central Asia when they arrive in Silicon Valley.</li>
<li>Continue and expand partnerships between Silcrowd Innovation Hub, Astana Hub, and the region’s IT hubs to enter the US market.</li>
<li>HP will provide materials on corporate venture and access to educational/incubation programs to ecosystem participants.</li>
<li>Focus a separate support track for women founders together with AmCham and relevant UN initiatives.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Collect participant contacts and send out materials: the HP presentation, links to HP Life/HP Garage, and incubator terms.</li>
<li>Organize an online office-hours series with mentors from the diaspora (Silicon Valley) on the topics of 'day zero in the US,' networking, compliance, and hiring.</li>
<li>Hold a practical workshop on positioning and GTM for B2B/B2C AI startups (ICP, value proposition, pilot scenarios).</li>
<li>Form a pool of corporate pilots with HP Tech Ventures and partners for startups from Central Asia.</li>
<li>Launch a call for applications to incubation programs (Silcrowd/Astana Hub/partners) with a separate subprogram for women founders.</li>
<li>Prepare a 'Go-to-US: founder’s checklist' guide with cases of the first 100 customers and 'give-first' networking schemes.</li></ul>
