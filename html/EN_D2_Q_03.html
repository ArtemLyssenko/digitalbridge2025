      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed turning Central Asia and the Caucasus into a single technology and AI hub: joint promotion of the region and exporting startups under a common brand, aligning regulation for a single market, developing regional venture (including a fund of funds) and scaling talent through shared educational and research programs with global partners, backed by shared infrastructure (HPC/AI Super Cloud) and overseas hubs.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Position Central Asia and the Caucasus as a single global center for AI and startups</li>
<li>Establish a common market and rules of the game for scaling startups across the region</li>
<li>Develop regional venture infrastructure (a fund of funds and joint VCs)</li>
<li>Create an end-to-end pipeline of AI talent and R&D through partnerships with leading universities</li>
<li>Unify infrastructure (HPC, AI Super Cloud, accelerators, overseas hubs) for shared access</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to promote the region’s competitive advantages in the global market under a single brand?</li>
<li>What steps are needed to create a unified AI-startup ecosystem and a single market?</li>
<li>How to optimally structure regional venture instruments (including a fund of funds)?</li>
<li>Which model of joint AI-talent training and research is most effective?</li>
<li>With which global research centers should we build sustainable partnerships and exchanges?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The region has strong demographic and educational potential, political stability, and a favorable geography between the East and West</li>
<li>Astana Hub and IT Park Uzbekistan are already jointly promoting startups as "Central Asia", opening overseas branches and launching joint acceleration programs</li>
<li>ЕАБР, through the Digital Initiatives Fund, supports integration-oriented digital projects with grants, investments, and loans; an Astana Hub grant for an AI platform and AI Super Cloud has been signed</li>
<li>A single market requires harmonization of terms, definitions, and regulation so that scaling from one country would automatically open up the whole region</li>
<li>Regional venture funds and participation of institutionals as LPs in a fund of funds are needed to multiply capital</li>
<li>Coordination is paramount: a shared roadmap of events, promotional activities, and joint programs reduces duplication and amplifies impact</li>
<li>AI has leveled the playing field for regions: small teams are able to create globally competitive solutions; the example of a local unicorn confirms the potential</li>
<li>It is critically important to shift the focus of education toward AI engineering and R&D; launch TOT programs for instructors and scale online learning</li>
<li>The researcher diaspora and partnerships with MIT, Stanford, Cambridge, ETH Zurich, KAIST, KOICA, etc. can accelerate knowledge transfer and the launch of deep tech</li>
<li>Shared infrastructure (supercomputer, AI Super Cloud) and joint centers should serve the regions, not individual countries</li></ul>
