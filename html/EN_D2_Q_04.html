      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel revealed how China built leadership in AI: a national strategy since 2017, large-scale investments, talent repatriation, and data abundance. Barriers and windows of opportunity for foreign startups in the Chinese market were discussed, as well as the role of Big Tech (Alibaba) and “patient” capital in the ecosystem. A separate focus was cybersecurity as a prerequisite for digital transformation and a trust model through transparency and localization. Kazakhstan was viewed as a promising hub for collaborations, pilots, and regional expansion.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Understand the key factors that enabled China to become a leader in AI and innovation</li>
<li>Assess the openness of the Chinese market to foreign startups and entry pathways</li>
<li>Determine the role of corporations (e.g., Alibaba) and venture capital in the ecosystem</li>
<li>Identify cybersecurity requirements and trust models for cross-border work</li>
<li>Outline cooperation formats between China and Kazakhstan in AI and deeptech</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>When and through what measures did China systematically choose a course toward leadership in AI and innovation?</li>
<li>How realistic and labor-intensive is it for foreign startups to enter the Chinese market, and what is required?</li>
<li>How does Big Tech (Alibaba) integrate AI into strategy, and what opportunities does this open for partners?</li>
<li>What is the role of the state’s and corporations’ “patient capital” for the startup ecosystem?</li>
<li>What principles allow cybersecurity companies to build trust and localize outside of China?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>China’s national AI strategy launched in 2017: trillion-scale investments, 11 pilot zones, and support for more than 5,000 AI companies.</li>
<li>China leads in academic publications (about 23% of the global total) and up to 69% of AI patents; mass talent repatriation and access to data (10 times more than in the West) amplified the surge.</li>
<li>Entering the Chinese market is difficult: intense cluster competition, different digital infrastructure (Western services are inaccessible without a VPN); success — <1% without local expertise.</li>
<li>Early-stage startup — not the time for China: first achieve PMF and traction at home, then test hypotheses via short cycles and local partners.</li>
<li>An alternative to direct entry is to become a regional partner of Chinese deeptech companies and build Central Asia hubs for their expansion.</li>
<li>Corporate co-innovation delivers “quick wins”: working through international corporations’ networks and pilots increases trust and the chances of investment.</li>
<li>Alibaba has shifted focus to AI-first: AI is the core of all BUs; an example is the AKEO AI agent, automating ≈70% of a B2B buyer’s routine tasks.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan demonstrates favorable conditions: flexible regulation (Digital Code), infrastructure, a young talent pool, and the launch of an international AI center (AlemAI).</li>
<li>Venture perspective: the state’s “patient capital” is critical for long cycles (semiconductors example — 17 years to exit); large corporations create tracks for exits.</li>
<li>Cybersecurity is a precondition for the AI digital economy: trust is built through transparency, audits, opening code, technology transfer, localization of data centers, and team training.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“It was a chemical reaction between policy and market support.” — <span class="author">Xu Tianmeng</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Nothing is impossible. But it won’t be easy, especially for startups, especially in China.” — <span class="author">Wei Zhou</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Today we are a giant in AI and e-commerce.” — <span class="author">Frank Lyudvin Shefer</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We’re not a microwave; we’re more like an oven.” — <span class="author">Tomas G. Tsao</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>China’s leadership in AI is the result of a long-term strategy, large-scale investments, talent, and data availability, reinforced by market dynamics.</li>
<li>For foreign startups, China is realistic given PMF, localization, strong partners, and short hypothesis-testing cycles.</li>
<li>AI-first strategies of corporations (e.g., Alibaba) create new B2B tools and demand for partner ecosystems.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan can serve as a regional node for pilots, cybersecurity, and technology transfer between China and Central Asia.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Launch a joint Astana Hub and XNode program for rapid PMF testing and partnerships in the Chinese market.</li>
<li>Begin scoping the opening of a local CUEX office/joint lab in Kazakhstan with an emphasis on technology transfer and training.</li>
<li>Support the development of partnerships with Alibaba within Kazakhstan’s AI agenda and the capabilities of the AlemAI center.</li>
<li>Gobi Partners to initiate an assessment of opening an office and forming an investment pipeline in Kazakhstan.</li>
<li>Form a model of a regional hub to bring Chinese deeptech companies to Central Asian markets through local partners.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Astana Hub and XNode: design a 3–4-month pilot PMF program (diagnostics, rapid pilots, partner matching, legal and cultural onboarding).</li>
<li>Government and industry regulators: clarify Digital Code practices for AI/data, focusing on cross-border flows and localization.</li>
<li>CUEX with local partners: develop a roadmap for creating a SOC/lab, local data centers, and personnel certification programs.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan’s corporate sector: select 5–7 cases for pilots with Chinese deeptech (robotics, logistics, O&G, smart infrastructure).</li>
<li>Organize a China–Central Asia Deeptech Roadshow: delegation visits, B2B matching, sessions on compliance and cross-cultural work.</li>
<li>Create an English-/Chinese-/Russian-language market entry package for China: requirements, sales channels, partnership models, localization checklists.</li>
<li>Gobi Partners: conduct a screening of Kazakhstan’s startups in the areas of “concrete intelligence,” cybersecurity, industrial AI, and robotics.</li></ul>
