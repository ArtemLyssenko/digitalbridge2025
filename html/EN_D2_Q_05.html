      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session showed how Japan and Korea build ecosystems through universities, government, and business, and where Central Asia fits in. Opportunities of IVS (including IVS Youth and Launchpad) and the global fund Headline VC were presented. The engineer shortage in Japan and employment channels via People Cloud were discussed. A separate emphasis was placed on inclusive programs for women and people with disabilities, as well as potential formats for international cooperation with the countries of Central Asia.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Identify workable cooperation models between the ecosystems of Japan, Korea, and Central Asia</li>
<li>Show youth and entrepreneurial opportunities of IVS and their scaling beyond Japan</li>
<li>Form an understanding of priority sectors for venture investments and startup expansion into global markets</li>
<li>Connect engineering talent from Central Asia with Japanese demand via People Cloud and adjacent channels</li>
<li>Advance inclusive entrepreneurship support programs for women and people with disabilities</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Which mechanisms are effective for jointly building the university–business–government ecosystem?</li>
<li>How to engage companies in working with school and university students, providing internships and practical training?</li>
<li>Which sectors are currently most attractive for venture capital in Japan and the region?</li>
<li>How does Japan address the engineer shortage and the language barrier when hiring international specialists?</li>
<li>Which programs in Japan and Korea support women entrepreneurs and people with disabilities?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>IVS started in 2007 in Miyazaki as an invite-only boutique conference; since 2023 it has been open to all, 13,000 participants in the main part and about 500 side events over 3–4 days, totaling up to 50,000 participants in the host city (Kyoto).</li>
<li>IVS’s flagship program is Launchpad: over 18 years, hundreds of finalists, around 30 IPOs and ~35 M&A; most Japanese unicorns presented at IVS at early stages.</li>
<li>Headline VC is a global fund (~$4B AUM) with offices in America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia; focus on global founders and markets.</li>
<li>Priority investment areas: e-commerce, web/internet services, AI, entertainment, commercial technologies; strong categories of Japanese unicorns — B2B internet services (including HR/Smart), B2C apps (e.g., Mercari), deeptech/materials.</li>
<li>VC market comparison: Japan ~$20B, Korea ~$8.8B, Kazakhstan ~$71M; VC as a share of GDP in Japan is low but growing; Central Asia has the potential for rapid growth with access to international capital.</li>
<li>People Cloud helps engineers from Eastern Europe and Central Asia get jobs in Japan: a shortage of hundreds of thousands of engineers, a visa is now available if you have an offer; the language barrier is easing, and the number of positions for non-Japanese speakers is growing.</li>
<li>Practical employment channels: the 'Hello, Япония' project, the Tokyo Dev and LinkedIn platforms; People Cloud runs free cohorts for Japanese-language courses and familiarization visits to Japan.</li>
<li>Japan is accelerating entrepreneurship education: university entrepreneurship departments, project-based learning in schools, student and school pitch competitions (including IVS Youth).</li>
<li>Korea actively subsidizes company launches with dedicated tracks (for women, foreigners, 60+), including monthly grants for 6 months when registering a business in the country.</li>
<li>Cultural shift in Japan: from lifetime employment to greater mobility; startups need to balance traditional quality with the need for speed in hypothesis testing.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“If you want to come to Japan, all you need is an offer.” — <span class="author">Anatolii Kolbinov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We want to become the number one platform for all Asian startups.” — <span class="author">Viplus Wang</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The university–business–government linkage with an emphasis on youth and inclusion fosters sustainable ecosystem growth (as seen in IVS and Korean programs).</li>
<li>Central Asia is on the verge of scaling: plugging into IVS platforms and global capital (Headline VC and others) can speed up the emergence of global projects and talent mobility.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Open a window for participation of startups and students from Central Asia in the next IVS and IVS Youth cycle.</li>
<li>Hold a CV Roast session today with the participation of Anatolii Kolbinov and an IT university to provide targeted feedback to candidates.</li>
<li>Initiate development of joint student programs/hackathons between schools and universities of Kazakhstan and Japanese partners (through IVS Youth).</li>
<li>Organize post-session follow-ups with all interested parties for individual tracks (investments, internships, participation in programs).</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Compile a list of interested participants from Central Asia and send out information on registration/selection for IVS and IVS Youth.</li>
<li>Launch a pilot cross-border hackathon/pitch track (KZ–JP/KR) with online mentorship and access to IVS investors in the coming quarter.</li>
<li>Prepare a short guide for Central Asian startups on accessing Headline VC and Asian grant programs (women’s/inclusive tracks).</li>
<li>Promote employment channels in Japan: the 'Hello, Япония' project, Tokyo Dev, LinkedIn; open registration for free Japanese-language courses from People Cloud.</li>
<li>Form a working group on localizing IVS educational activities in the region (lists of schools/universities, partners, event calendar).</li></ul>
