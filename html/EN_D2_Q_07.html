      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how European countries strike a balance between AI innovation and regulation through trust, ethics, and sustainability. France presented the results of its national strategy: growth in research, startups, and 'green' computing infrastructure. Spain (Madrid) showcased data governance practices: ethics committees, an AI office, transparency, and support for SMEs. The United Kingdom described a four-principle approach: ambition, talent, investment, and pragmatic regulation, relevant for Central Asia.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show European approaches to balancing AI innovation and regulation with a focus on trust and sustainability</li>
<li>Exchange practices of national strategies (France, Spain, United Kingdom) and their applicability to Central Asia</li>
<li>Discuss data governance: privacy, consent, data spaces, and ethical mechanisms</li>
<li>Define the role of the state in investment, compute capacity, and workforce development</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Which regulatory format is more effective for AI: a centralized (single act) or a decentralized sectoral approach?</li>
<li>How to ensure citizens' privacy and consent when using data to train models and generative AI?</li>
<li>What investments and partnerships are needed to scale compute infrastructure and 'green' energy?</li>
<li>How to train and attract talent (visas, grants, training for civil servants) for a sustainable AI ecosystem?</li>
<li>Does AI exacerbate global inequality or create a window of opportunity for developing countries?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The French AI strategy (since 2018, 'AI for Humanity') is based on R&D and education, an innovation ecosystem, priority verticals, ethics, and substantial funding; the course is reinforced through 2030.</li>
<li>France's results: growth in publications and labs, over 1,000 AI companies, the emergence of notable players (including open‑source LLM), advancement in global rankings.</li>
<li>France is betting on sustainable compute infrastructure: affordable energy (nuclear, renewables), sites for data centers, and major international partnerships (including a summit and AI campus projects).</li>
<li>Madrid has built data governance through data lakes, a central AI office, and ethics committees (especially in healthcare), ensuring de‑identification, transparency, and citizen consent.</li>
<li>Spain combines the requirements of the AI Act, Data Act, and GDPR with the development of innovation: support for SMEs (~150 players), training programs for civil servants, and standardization of compliance processes.</li>
<li>The United Kingdom highlights 4 principles: ambition (transformation of public services), talent (visas, grants, links with top universities), investment (compute, data centers, shared capacity and data), pragmatic regulation.</li>
<li>Regulatory design depends on objectives: different jurisdictions choose a central or sectoral approach; inaction is not an option — regulation must be 'smart' and risk‑based.</li>
<li>The key to trust is protecting privacy and creators' rights: GDPR and informed consent, balancing the interests of the creative industry and innovation.</li>
<li>Education and the involvement of youth and practitioners in rule‑making are critical so that norms do not lag behind technology and support employment, not just automation.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We want to become a trusted and sustainable leader in AI.” — <span class="author">Mari - Laur Returo</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Sitting and doing nothing is not an option.” — <span class="author">Charli Moris</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We inform our citizens what their data are used for and ask for their consent.” — <span class="author">Migel Lopes Valverde</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“It is important that people trust AI — then society will be able to adapt the technologies across all sectors.” — <span class="author">Mari - Laur Returo</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Fear won't stop it — the best strategy is to embrace the technology and steer it for good.” — <span class="author">Mari - Laur Returo</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The European model is built on trust and 'smart' regulation: AI development goes hand‑in‑hand with ethics, data protection, and transparency, as well as investments in R&D, talent, and sustainable compute.</li>
<li>The practices of France, Spain, and the United Kingdom show that balance is achievable through institutions (AI offices, committees), infrastructure (energy, data centers), support for SMEs, and the state's participation as a partner.</li>
<li>For Central Asia, the window of opportunity is to combine energy and resource advantages with clear rules, talent programs, and cross‑country partnerships.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Support continuation of the EU–Central Asia dialogue on 'smart' AI regulation and exchange of practices.</li>
<li>Focus on transparency and protection of citizens' data (GDPR‑like principles, consent and de‑identification) as the foundation of trust.</li>
<li>Encourage SMEs and startups to pursue compliance and innovation through special offices/competence centers and training programs.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Organize a joint workshop for regulators and industry in Central Asia on implementing AI Act‑compatible practices (ethics, risk assessment, consent, data spaces).</li>
<li>Launch data spaces pilots (e.g., in healthcare) with de‑identification and ethics committees, using Madrid's experience.</li>
<li>Prepare an investment roadmap for compute and 'green' infrastructure (energy, data centers) together with European partners.</li>
<li>Develop visa and grant programs to attract AI talent and training tracks for civil servants on responsible data use.</li>
<li>Create guidelines for SMEs on complying with the AI Act/GDPR and applying generative AI with protection of IP/content.</li></ul>
