      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how hardware infrastructure (chips, data centers, logistics) is becoming the foundation for deploying AI and robotics. Robot manufacturers highlighted the main scaling obstacles: cost, shortages of data and models, as well as manipulators/grippers. Kazakhstan was considered a promising node of digital and physical infrastructure with pilots in drone delivery and warehouse automation. Companies are targeting hybrid models: combining in-house hardware, open SDKs, and co-developing use cases with customers.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Define the role of hardware infrastructure as the foundation for the growth of AI and robotics</li>
<li>Formulate priority use cases and monetization models (including Robots-as-a-Service)</li>
<li>Assess scaling challenges: cost, data/models, skills, and regulation</li>
<li>Outline partnerships and pilots in Kazakhstan for logistics, warehouses, and digital hubs</li>
<li>Agree on an approach to data collection and the creation of agent and digital twin platforms</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to accelerate the deployment of compute and logistics infrastructure for AI?</li>
<li>Which robotics use cases are most economically justified in the next 3–5 years?</li>
<li>Which business model is more effective: direct sales or end-to-end Robots-as-a-Service?</li>
<li>How to solve the shortage of data and models for autonomous robots and manipulators?</li>
<li>What role can Kazakhstan play as a regional hub and testbed for pilots?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Globally there are more than 11,000 data centers and over 8 million AI servers shipped; by 2030 the world will require large-scale investment in compute capacity.</li>
<li>Lenovo is pursuing a hybrid strategy: AI‑accelerated manufacturing, smart warehouses, and digital twins; more than 150 million units of computing solutions have been delivered to customers.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan is viewed by Lenovo as a neighboring market with logistical advantages (BRI/Belt and Road Initiative) and potential for creating digital and physical hubs.</li>
<li>The robotics market is growing: according to IFR, more than 440 manufacturers and ~200 thousand sales; top scenarios — logistics, service, cleaning, agriculture, safety/rescue.</li>
<li>Unitree: the main barriers of the next decade are the lack of data and efficient models for robots; manipulation tasks are especially challenging (grippers ≠ human fingers).</li>
<li>Open SDKs/APIs and a DIY approach are important for customization to industry scenarios and for accelerating secondary development on the customer side.</li>
<li>Deep Robotics started with industrial tasks (inspection of electrical substations), the focus is to create real value in applied scenarios and bring robots into everyday life.</li>
<li>Freedom Holding is launching drone‑delivery pilots in Almaty, plans to automate 10–20 warehouses, and to run AI models locally on NVIDIA GPUs to orchestrate the robot fleet.</li>
<li>The key operational challenge is management scalability: today one operator manages one robot; the goal is 1 operator for 4–5 robots.</li>
<li>Reducing cost through scale and standardization is critical for mass adoption of robots in everyday life and service industries.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“AI is a technology that needs infrastructure: first physical, then digital.” — <span class="author">Khok Syuy</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The biggest challenge for the next decade is data and models for robots.” — <span class="author">Irving Chen</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Our philosophy is to take robots out of laboratories and solve real problems.” — <span class="author">Syuzanna Lo</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Today one operator manages one robot; we need to get to managing four to five.” — <span class="author">Yerlan Yesimseitov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“To stay on the cutting edge, we combine in‑house development with ecosystem partnerships.” — <span class="author">Khok Syuy</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The hardware backbone is the key to scaling AI: without compute, logistics, and energy foundations, the application of AI and robots is limited.</li>
<li>The next mass use cases for robots are logistics and service; household scenarios will accelerate as hardware gets cheaper and data/models emerge.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan is ready to play the role of a regional testbed for pilots and a hub, provided business, regulators, and universities cooperate.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Lenovo will work out partnerships in Kazakhstan to develop digital and warehouse infrastructure and to create a regional hub.</li>
<li>Unitree and Deep Robotics will maintain open SDKs/APIs and expand joint pilots with local customers for industry customization.</li>
<li>Freedom Holding will launch phased pilots: last‑mile drone delivery and warehouse automation with assessment of economic impact.</li>
<li>The parties agree to coordinate data collection and labeling to train robotics and digital twin models.</li>
<li>Focus on reducing the TCO of robots through scaling and standardization of components/software.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Form a working group (Lenovo, local operators, regulators) to design a digital/physical hub and smart warehouses in the Republic of Kazakhstan.</li>
<li>Launch 2–3 industry RaaS pilots: infrastructure inspection, in‑plant logistics, security/patrol.</li>
<li>Deploy a drone‑delivery pilot in Almaty with SLA, safety, and economic metrics; prepare to scale to 5+ locations.</li>
<li>Build a data pipeline for robots: collection, simulation, labeling; launch training of small models/agents on local GPUs.</li>
<li>Conduct a techno‑economic assessment of automating 10–20 warehouses: ROI, CAPEX/OPEX, WMS/OMS integration.</li>
<li>Prepare regulatory sandboxes for ground robots and cooperative control (1 operator per 4–5 devices).</li></ul>
