      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how startups can reach Series A: metrics, going global, and the role of focus. The need for an AI-first approach and readiness for pivots as a growth norm was highlighted. Higgsfield AI and Kodi Play unpacked practices of hyper-iterations, a hardworking culture, and global distribution. The Alem fund of funds announced a strategy to catalyze the ecosystem through investments in regional and global funds and hybrid corporate ventures.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Clarify metrics and readiness for Series A, including new market revenue thresholds</li>
<li>Show working strategies for entering global markets with R&D in Kazakhstan</li>
<li>Substantiate AI-first as the standard for products and business models</li>
<li>Discuss the role of a fund of funds in scaling the number of GPs and launching hybrid corporate venture funds</li>
<li>Highlight the value of rapid pivots and investor support at early stages</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What metrics and thresholds are actually needed today to raise a Series A?</li>
<li>Which scaling route is more effective: to 'test' locally or go global right away?</li>
<li>What does AI-first mean in practice across different verticals, and how to avoid 'wrappers' without deep technology?</li>
<li>How will a fund of funds support first-time GPs, corporate funds, and the diaspora?</li>
<li>How do investors view pivots and what should a startup do if it's stuck at the seed stage?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Series A is the point of proven product–market fit and the start of scaling; on average: valuation ~$50M, check ~$10M, revenue ~$10M.</li>
<li>The threshold to start a Series A dialogue has risen: in 2024 the benchmark is from ~$3M in annual revenue.</li>
<li>Only about 10% of those who raised seed reach Series A; virtually all successful cases from the region sell to global markets while keeping R&D in Kazakhstan.</li>
<li>AI-first is becoming a requirement: without adopting AI, businesses lose competitiveness and margin.</li>
<li>Higgsfield AI illustrates a hyper-iteration strategy (releases 5 times a week), focus, and distribution as a combined moat; the video-AI market is a new, fast-growing segment.</li>
<li>Kodi Play scaled to 13 countries thanks to partnerships with AI labs, social-network distribution, and a hardworking culture; in EdTech, demand is shifting from digital skills to AI as a subject.</li>
<li>Pivots are the norm: even large companies change vectors; lingering at one stage without multiples of growth is a signal to change market/model.</li>
<li>Copycat models in the local market are possible but hard to scale; the key is to plan the exit in advance and work with strategics.</li>
<li>Alem Ventures Fund (fund of funds) invests in local/regional/global funds, supports first-time GPs, and launches hybrid corporate venture funds with independent management.</li>
<li>The quality of the region’s human capital is a strong side; the diaspora and international LP/GP partnerships are important drivers of the ecosystem.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“If you don’t add AI, you’ll just get stuck and sooner or later die.” — <span class="author">Zhanadil Taldybayev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Today there is no startup without the AI tag... either you implement it, or you will gradually die.” — <span class="author">Murat Abdrakhmanov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We assume that in three years every other video on social networks will be generated with AI, and it will be generated with Higgs Field.” — <span class="author">Aleks Mashrabov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Through Alem Ventures Fund, a fund of funds, we plan to invest... in all funds in Kazakhstan, in the region and, of course, globally, to mitigate risks.” — <span class="author">Askar Bilisbekov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We never enter a project unless we understand how we will exit it.” — <span class="author">Murat Abdrakhmanov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“At an early stage it is very hard to find investor support... only Murat and May Seven supported us.” — <span class="author">Aleks Mashrabov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The Series A market has tightened: you need mature metrics, clear focus, and proven global distribution.</li>
<li>AI-first and readiness for rapid pivots are key differentiators of surviving companies.</li>
<li>A fund of funds and hybrid corporate venture funds can multiply the number of GPs and quality startups in the region.</li>
<li>Betting on human capital and the diaspora strengthens international integration and capital flows.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Alem Ventures Fund focuses on investing in regional and global funds with an emphasis on first-time GPs.</li>
<li>Launch and scale a program of hybrid corporate venture funds managed by independent GPs.</li>
<li>Organize LP/GP educational initiatives jointly with top-tier funds to raise market expertise.</li>
<li>Support diaspora funds and initiatives investing in companies founded by people from the region.</li>
<li>The ecosystem is oriented toward a go-global strategy for startups from the very start.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Founders: validate the path to Series A metrics (ARR ≥ $3M, growth, unit economics) and plan the round in advance.</li>
<li>Build an AI-first product: from integrating AI into core processes to developing your own models where it creates a moat.</li>
<li>Set a high iteration pace (weekly releases), retention and virality metrics; set horizons for pivots.</li>
<li>Go global from day one: target large markets and appropriate jurisdictions, build international distribution.</li>
<li>GPs and corporations: prepare independent governance structures for hybrid corporate funds and investment committees.</li>
<li>Alem/KVG: roll out LP/GP education and follow-up meetings after the LP summit; expand the AIFC license for the planned activities.</li>
<li>Network with the diaspora and top funds: form a pipeline of co-investments and talent scouting from the region.</li></ul>
