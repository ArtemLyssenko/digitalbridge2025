      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed why in Kazakhstan and the region corporations remain the weak link in the startup ecosystem and how AI can become a catalyst for cooperation. The speakers highlighted systemic barriers: lack of strategic embedding of innovation, blurred accountability, and cultural resistance within corporations. Practices were presented: the venture client model at PASHA Holding, internal development and API partnerships at Береке Банк, as well as a B Global Ventures study on corporate innovation. The consensus: acceleration is possible through strategy, fast POC validation, standards and incentives, and the creation of exit channels (M&A/CVC).</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Identify the reasons why corporations have not become key partners for startups in Kazakhstan and the region</li>
<li>Understand whether AI can become a catalyst and a “bridge” between startups and corporations</li>
<li>Shape workable engagement models: venture client, pilots, CVC, M&A</li>
<li>Define the role of the state and regulatory incentives to accelerate corporate innovation</li>
<li>Share case studies and practices for scaling pilots into production</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Why do corporate innovation efforts develop slowly, and where is the breakdown — in corporations, startups, or regulation?</li>
<li>What changes in corporate strategy and structure are needed for AI and innovation to become a systemic part of the business?</li>
<li>Can AI become the connecting link and accelerator of pilots and deployments?</li>
<li>How to motivate industries with low competition and a high state share to innovate?</li>
<li>How to create more exit channels (M&A, CVC) and new “buyers” of startups beyond a handful of players?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>B Global Ventures presented the first industry study on corporate innovation in the region and stated the goal: awareness-raising and standardization of practices.</li>
<li>Corporate innovation must be part of the company’s 1–2 year strategy with regular reviews; AI is a cross-cutting theme, not a patch for current problems.</li>
<li>A clear responsibility matrix is needed: who inside the corporation owns which innovation process (HR, document workflow, ERP, analytics, etc.).</li>
<li>Cultural resistance (especially among middle management and the IT function) is one of the main stoppers; value for the rank-and-file employee is critical for adoption.</li>
<li>The exit market is narrow: many corporations want to be enterprise clients but not buyers; about 81% prefer the B2B model instead of M&A.</li>
<li>Береке Банк bets on internal development, SAFe, API partnerships, and acceleration; pilots quickly convert into scalable services (a case with MasterCard).</li>
<li>PASHA Holding combined startup acquisitions in the past but now focuses on the venture client model and subsidizing pilots in subsidiaries; M&A is not planned in the near term.</li>
<li>In highly competitive industries (banking, telecom) innovation moves faster; in sectors with a high state share, incentives and standards are needed (e.g., API standards, incentives for CVC).</li>
<li>The economic structure dominated by B2G constrains the development of B2B and demand for innovation; a shift toward the market and a stronger role for SMEs is needed.</li>
<li>Fast POCs (weeks, not months) and pinpoint scouting of solutions for specific pains are the key to successful cooperation (the Plug and Play approach).</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Our panel discussion is called “AI as a Bridge.” Can there be cooperation between startups and corporations in the AI era?” — <span class="author">Anuar Lenzat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Corporate innovation must sit at the core of the company’s strategy.” — <span class="author">Alibek Sultangazin</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“For us, innovation is not buying for flashy headlines but real solutions for our customers.” — <span class="author">Gulmira Akinbanshina</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“However clichéd it may sound, competition is a driver of progress, a driver of growth.” — <span class="author">Khusein Makhmudov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“This is a session about corporate innovation, and there are no corporations here.” — <span class="author">Alim Khamitov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Without strategic integration of innovation and clear internal accountability, pilots do not scale and do not lead to exits.</li>
<li>AI can become a practical “bridge” if used in specific processes (data, document workflow, HR, analytics) and if solutions are validated with fast POCs.</li>
<li>The role of the state is to create rules and incentives (standards, benefits for CVC), especially in low-competition industries.</li>
<li>The market needs new corporate “buyers” of startups and the venture client approach as an intermediate step toward M&A.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>B Global Ventures publishes an industry report on corporate innovation and collects feedback for subsequent iterations.</li>
<li>Береке Банк confirms its course toward internal development, SAFe, and API partnerships, scaling pilots through its own acceleration.</li>
<li>PASHA Holding maintains a focus on the venture client approach and subsidizing pilots in portfolio companies; no new M&A is planned in the near term.</li>
<li>Plug and Play will explore launching an industry program in Kazakhstan if there is corporate demand.</li>
<li>The panel organizers will pass the collected theses and recommendations to key corporations and relevant government bodies.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>For corporations: review 12–24 month strategies to include AI initiatives and KPIs for scaling pilots.</li>
<li>Appoint owners of innovation processes (HR/finance/operations/IT/analytics) and allocate budgets for venture client pilots.</li>
<li>Implement fast POC processes (weeks) and unified legal templates for pilots with startups.</li>
<li>For the state: develop industry-specific API standards and tax/regulatory incentives for CVC and pilots with domestic startups.</li>
<li>Launch training programs for corporate management (working with startups, ROI assessment, risk management, AI case studies).</li>
<li>For the ecosystem: expand the list of corporate buyers via industry clubs, case sharing, and public showcases of needs.</li>
<li>For funds and hubs: organize targeted scouting based on industry requests (agro, manufacturing, logistics) and benchmarking of exportable solutions.</li>
<li>Track metrics: share of pilots, conversion to contract/scale-up, POC time, number of corporate exits.</li></ul>
