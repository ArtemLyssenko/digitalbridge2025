      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel focused on the role of women investors in shaping the future through the applied use of AI. Speakers were unanimous: AI is a tool for industries, not an end in itself, and its value is revealed in specialized solutions. They discussed myths about AI (fear of job loss), the importance of government support (including the new Ministry of AI in Kazakhstan), and the need to strengthen women's participation as founders, LPs, and investors, including boosting confidence and the scale of ambitions.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show AI as a cross-industry efficiency tool rather than an end in itself.</li>
<li>Identify priority AI application areas for Central Asia (logistics, automotive, tourism, medtech, retail).</li>
<li>Strengthen women's participation in the venture ecosystem as founders, investors, and LPs; increase the sizes of checks raised.</li>
<li>Build understanding of the role of government policy and incentives in developing the AI ecosystem.</li>
<li>Dispel common misconceptions about AI and outline practical implementation steps.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Is AI a standalone product or a universal tool for industries?</li>
<li>Will AI take people's jobs or redistribute tasks and increase efficiency?</li>
<li>What is the specificity of the female approach to investing and how to reduce the gender gap in VC?</li>
<li>How does government support (e.g., a Ministry of AI) change the ecosystem's trajectory?</li>
<li>Where exactly in Central Asia can AI deliver maximum added value right now?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI in business is, first and foremost, a tool whose value is unlocked in narrowly specialized, industry-specific solutions.</li>
<li>The myth of "mass layoffs due to AI" is exaggerated: technologies redistribute work and increase efficiency (examples — translation, 360 HR assessment, targeting in retail).</li>
<li>Government support (incentives, policy, tax relief, as in Hangzhou/China) is critical for concentrating talent and accelerating AI clusters; the creation of a Ministry of AI in the Republic of Kazakhstan is a positive step.</li>
<li>Central Asia is young (avg. age ~27 years), which provides a window of opportunity to leapfrog into GenAI and adjacent areas; Kazakhstan has seen its first unicorn in GenAI.</li>
<li>Women make 70–80% of consumer decisions; their participation in development/investing brings products closer to the market and statistically increases portfolio profitability.</li>
<li>Bias persists in venture: women are asked questions about risks, men — about growth; it's important for women to ask for larger checks and more actively "take a seat at the table."</li>
<li>Corporate venture (the Astana Motors example) focuses on products for ecosystem growth (logistics, automotive) and check sizes of $0.5–1 million; proprietary venture studios accelerate launch.</li>
<li>A strong network and long-term partnership are key to startup survivability during turbulent periods; you can learn and enter venture at any age.</li>
<li>A promising area is AI/robotics to remove household drudgery, freeing women for creativity and entrepreneurship.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“AI is a tool, not an end in itself.” — <span class="author">Jessica Tams</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“You need to take a seat at the table now — not wait until you're 110% ready.” — <span class="author">Izlin Chan</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“I believe that here we can already not catch up, but leapfrog.” — <span class="author">Merey Ibragimova</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Investors are looking for women founders because, statistically, their portfolios are more profitable.” — <span class="author">Jessica Tams</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI will become a ubiquitous efficiency layer; teams that build specialized solutions around real industry needs will win.</li>
<li>Women are a critical resource for the ecosystem (as consumers, founders, and investors); eliminating bias and increasing their role raises overall ROI.</li>
<li>A combination of government support, young talent, and corporate venture enables Central Asia to carve out a niche in global AI by leapfrogging rather than "catching up."</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Support the course of using AI as an applied tool in cross-industry use cases, not "AI for AI's sake."</li>
<li>Recognize the creation of a Ministry of AI in Kazakhstan as an important ecosystem driver and use available incentives.</li>
<li>Strengthen targeted support for women founders and women investors (LP/BA), encouraging requests for larger investment checks.</li>
<li>Develop corporate venture initiatives and venture studios in priority sectors (logistics, automotive, tourism, retail).</li>
<li>Make the women's panel on AI investing a regular part of Digital Bridge for sustainable networking and exchange of practices.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Launch targeted Digital Bridge/TechnoWoman AI workshops for founders and investors (productization, MLOps, industry use cases).</li>
<li>Organize a women's angel/LP track (together with Big Sky Capital and corporate funds) with mentorship and syndications.</li>
<li>Prepare a regional study on gender pitching patterns and portfolio outcomes (Central Asia), with recommendations for VCs.</li>
<li>Assemble AI pilots for the real sector: translation/localization, 360 HR assessment, mall targeting, routing in tourism, predictive analytics in automotive/logistics.</li>
<li>Develop a techno-economic concept for a "home AI assistant" (robotics + ML) to automate routine tasks.</li></ul>
