      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The talk presented the evolution of Korea’s venture ecosystem and the role of the government fund of funds in the growth of unicorns and deep tech. Government ambitions were outlined — to reach top 3 in AI and top 4 in venture investment, including launching infrastructure with 10,000 GPUs and supporting 50 unicorns. A model for mobilizing pension and insurance capital into VC and globalization through 74 international funds was shown. The high potential of partnership with Kazakhstan was emphasized, aligned with the strategy of digital transformation and the creation of joint platforms and funds.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Accelerate the growth of AI and deep tech through long-term capital and world-class infrastructure</li>
<li>Strengthen Korea’s global competitiveness as Asia’s regional venture hub</li>
<li>Scale the participation of institutional investors (pension and insurance funds) in the venture market</li>
<li>Build a sustainable foundation for Korea–Kazakhstan venture cooperation</li>
<li>Support the creation and scaling of 50 innovative unicorns</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to structure joint Korea–Kazakhstan funds for AI and deep tech given the risks of a 5–10-year horizon?</li>
<li>What regulatory and institutional changes are needed in Kazakhstan to scale the PPP model in venture capital?</li>
<li>How to involve pension funds and insurance companies in the VC asset class without increasing their aggregate risk?</li>
<li>How to ensure startups’ access to infrastructure (10,000 GPUs) and international capital at early stages?</li>
<li>What mechanisms will reduce the technological and market risks of commercializing deep tech in the region?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Korea entered the world’s top 10 economies largely thanks to semiconductors, biotechnology, and renewables, which accelerated the development of the venture market.</li>
<li>The government-backed fund of funds (Panja Fund), created in 2005 with the participation of KVIC, became a catalyst for early investments and market recovery.</li>
<li>Panja Fund reached 45 trillion KRW (~USD 30 billion), financing 11,000 companies; the footprint expanded through 74 global funds (US, Singapore, etc.).</li>
<li>Strong cases have emerged: Rebellion (AI chips, unicorn status), Kriosa (NPU chips), Upstage (proprietary language model).</li>
<li>The Korean government announced a goal — top 3 in AI and top 4 in venture investment; infrastructure for 10,000 GPUs, development of independent AI models, and talent attraction are planned.</li>
<li>The plan is to invest 1 trillion KRW in the venture market and support 50 innovative unicorns.</li>
<li>The 'Unicorn Project' was launched (July): ~600 billion KRW for investments in AI and deep tech to bridge the early-stage 'valley of death.'</li>
<li>Institutional participation is scaling: pension funds (including NPS) and insurance companies as key LPs for joint funds.</li>
<li>KVIC is building Korea as a regional venture hub, connecting Korean startups with global capital (Asia–US–Europe) and ensuring continuity of financing.</li></ul>
