      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The speaker presented the 'Finance 3.0' vision: everyday cryptocurrency payments via card and QR, combined with investments and cashback. The Bybit Card and Bybit Pay products were showcased, along with their global infrastructure and integrations with national payment systems. The trend toward stablecoins and institutional adoption was highlighted. Plans were announced to launch solutions in Kazakhstan and expand partnerships with banks and regulators.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Integrate cryptocurrency into everyday payments (card and QR) without the need for conversion and transfers</li>
<li>Reduce the costs and time of international transfers and corporate settlements</li>
<li>Expand licensing coverage and compliance, deepen cooperation with local banks and regulators</li>
<li>Launch Bybit Pay in Kazakhstan with support for national QR payments in the coming quarter</li>
<li>Develop a suite of stablecoin-based financial services (credit lines, settlements, BNPL)</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How will Bybit compete with traditional banks in Kazakhstan given their strong cashback programs and low fees?</li>
<li>How are exchange-rate and volatility issues addressed when paying with cryptocurrency at POS and via QR?</li>
<li>What regulatory requirements (KYC/AML, licenses) cover everyday crypto payments and corporate settlements?</li>
<li>How is merchant onboarding and motivation ensured for accepting crypto payments through national QR systems?</li>
<li>What is the economic model behind cashback and stablecoin yields (8–12%), and how sustainable is it?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Bybit positions 'Finance 3.0': a single account for investments and spending, where crypto assets are available for payment without intermediate transfers.</li>
<li>Traditional payments suffer from high fees, limits, and long transfer times (SWIFT/SEPA up to 5 business days); crypto payments are intended to eliminate this.</li>
<li>Bybit has 75 million registered users, licenses in 13 jurisdictions, and 5 more in process.</li>
<li>Bybit Card (Visa/Mastercard): over 2 million cards issued, acceptance at 90+ million POS terminals (100+ million counting global networks), cashback up to 10%, stablecoin yields up to 8–12%.</li>
<li>Bybit Pay integrates with national systems (Pix, M-PESA, MoMo, local QR) and is already operating/piloting in Brazil, Argentina, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Armenia; coming soon—Thailand and Kazakhstan.</li>
<li>Use cases: P2P transfers, payments for purchases and charity via scanning a QR in the Bybit app with cashback accrual.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan: integration with national QR payments with the participation of the National Bank; the launch of solutions and invoice payment services under AFSA regulation is planned in Q4.</li>
<li>The strategy is not to compete but to complement banks (example: buying crypto through local banks, including Bank CenterCredit), uniting Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.</li>
<li>Roadmap: credit lines, a settlement system for large clients, crypto credit cards, and BNPL.</li>
<li>Partnership and incentive cases: large events and merch (for example, in Brazil—up to 30% cashback on tickets, 10% at stadiums), the Tomorrowland Brazil 2025 program.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Everyday crypto payments are becoming practical thanks to cards, QR integrations, and the trend toward stablecoins.</li>
<li>The 'Finance 3.0' model combines investments and spending, offering savings on fees and additional income (cashback and stablecoin yields).</li>
<li>Kazakhstan is one of the priority markets for launching QR crypto payments and corporate services under AFSA supervision.</li>
<li>Success is possible through partnership with banks and national payment systems, rather than direct competition.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Launch Bybit Pay in Kazakhstan with support for national QR payments in Q4.</li>
<li>Provide payment services under AFSA regulation, including invoice payment via scanning and digital settlements.</li>
<li>Continue integrations with national systems (Pix, MoMo, M-PESA) and expand coverage to Thailand and Kazakhstan.</li>
<li>Maintain the partnership model with local banks (including direct cryptocurrency purchases in banking apps).</li>
<li>Develop the product lineup: cashback programs, yield-bearing stablecoins, credit lines, and settlements for businesses.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Complete pilots and certification for connecting to Kazakhstan's national QR system and hold a public launch.</li>
<li>Organize merchant onboarding jointly with local banks and acquirers; prepare POS materials and training.</li>
<li>Launch a beta invoice payment service under AFSA and collect feedback from companies holding crypto assets.</li>
<li>Conduct a user education campaign on security, KYC/AML, taxes, and rules for using stablecoins.</li>
<li>Publish a roadmap for the crypto credit card and BNPL, including limit conditions and risk management.</li>
<li>Set up KPIs: share of daily transactions, average fee and transfer time compared to SWIFT/SEPA, merchant NPS.</li>
<li>Expand cashback offers through local partnerships (events, merch, transportation) and integration with loyalty programs.</li></ul>
