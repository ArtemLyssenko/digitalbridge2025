    <div class="content">
      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The talk emphasized that digital inclusion is more than handing out devices: it is access, voice, and agency in the digital environment. Data were presented on 2.6 billion offline users and the urban–rural divide (83% versus 48%). Emphasis was placed on the need for proactive, locally relevant policy and the inclusion of civil society. A call to move from mere access to meaningful connectivity and citizens’ digital agency by 2030.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Rethink digital inclusion as a combination of access, rights, participation, and agency.</li>
<li>Reduce the urban–rural divide in connectivity and quality of access.</li>
<li>Achieve meaningful connectivity for the global majority by 2030.</li>
<li>Create proactive, localized, and future-oriented digital policies and regulations.</li>
<li>Strengthen citizens’ digital and political literacy and the engagement of civil society.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How can we ensure “meaningful connectivity” (frequency, 4G speeds, device, access at home/at work/in education) for billions of people by 2030?</li>
<li>How to balance the speed of innovation (“rabbit”) and regulation (“tortoise”) without stifling innovation?</li>
<li>What mechanisms ensure that all stakeholders are represented at the table, including rural communities and vulnerable groups?</li>
<li>How to avoid copy-pasting other countries’ policies and achieve local relevance and effectiveness?</li>
<li>What digital and political literacy tools do users need for informed consent and data protection?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>2.6 billion people remain offline out of a global population of about 8 billion; the gap is especially pronounced in rural areas.</li>
<li>Digital inclusion is not only devices and connectivity, but also a voice, participation in rule-making, and a sense of agency.</li>
<li>Urban–rural divide in Internet use: 83% versus 48%, requiring targeted policy and investment.</li>
<li>The shift to “meaningful connectivity” includes daily internet access, speeds no less than 4G, a smartphone, and access in key settings of daily life.</li>
<li>Regulations are often reactive and lag behind innovation; a proactive, future-oriented regulatory framework is needed.</li>
<li>Direct copy-pasting of policies from other countries is unacceptable; localization and contextualization are necessary.</li>
<li>Digital and political literacy are critical: users must understand agreements, risk disclosures, and data processing rules.</li>
<li>Civil society is not optional but a mandatory participant in developing digital policy and advocating for the interests of the majority.</li>
<li>Tech diplomacy and appointing tech diplomats can level the power imbalance between states and major technology players.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Two point six billion people are currently offline.” — <span class="author">Акинсанми Тити</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The true digital equation is not just access; it is the right to voice your opinion and be heard.” — <span class="author">Акинсанми Тити</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“I always picture innovation as the rabbit and regulation as the tortoise.” — <span class="author">Акинсанми Тити</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We need to stop exporting technology for technology’s sake—policies must be locally relevant.” — <span class="author">Акинсанми Тити</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We must ensure that today’s breakthroughs do not create a future of tenants in the digital realm, but that everyone becomes its shareholder.” — <span class="author">Акинсанми Тити</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Without proactive, locally adapted policy, the digital divide will widen, exacerbating the exclusion of groups and the power imbalance.</li>
<li>The shift from “access” to “agency” is key to sustainable digital inclusion and human development.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Support the goal of achieving meaningful connectivity for the global majority by 2030.</li>
<li>Initiate the development of localized, future-oriented digital policies instead of copying others’ models.</li>
<li>Include civil society and representatives of rural communities in the process of creating regulations and digital literacy programs.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Conduct an audit of the urban–rural gap in connectivity and quality of access, disaggregated by regions and vulnerable groups.</li>
<li>Launch digital and political literacy programs with an emphasis on informed consent, safety, and data governance.</li>
<li>Create a multistakeholder working group (government, business, NGOs, academia) for proactive AI/tech regulation.</li>
<li>Design and pilot localization of digital public infrastructure modeled on successful examples (without direct copy-paste).</li>
<li>Prepare a tech diplomacy initiative, including appointing a tech diplomat and standards for engagement with large platforms.</li>
<li>Implement plain-language versions of user agreements and risk notification mechanisms for mass-market services.</li></ul>
