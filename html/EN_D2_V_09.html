      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The speaker asserts that AI is the next big wave despite the current hype and urges thinking big and choosing the right time to enter. An AI‑studio model is proposed as a launchpad for experiments and PMF discovery, with an understanding of the layers of the AI industry (applications, models, infrastructure, hardware/energy). Practical Freedom cases are shown: drone pilot projects, experiments with robots and assistants, as well as a plan to open access to its own AI platform. Risks, startups competing with ecosystems (speed/innovation versus distribution), and the horizons of robotics and healthcare are discussed.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show entrepreneurs real windows of opportunity in the AI era and how to properly assess timing</li>
<li>Propose an AI‑studio approach for systematic experiments and rapid identification of successful directions</li>
<li>Structure an understanding of the layers of the AI ecosystem and adjacent industries (infrastructure, hardware, energy)</li>
<li>Attract partners and a team to Freedom pilots (drones, robots, assistants) and to the AI platform</li>
<li>Highlight risks, uncertainties, and the strategy of startups competing against large ecosystems</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Is the current AI hype a bubble or a fundamental technological wave analogous to the internet after the dot‑com bust?</li>
<li>When does an experiment turn into a standalone business, and how do you recognize the emergence of organic growth (PMF)?</li>
<li>Which layer of the AI industry (applications, models, infrastructure, hardware/energy) should a startup play in, and what are the implications?</li>
<li>How can startups with innovation and speed compete with the distribution and resources of large ecosystems?</li>
<li>How viable are Data/Dataset as a Service business models, and how do you protect IP in this field?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI is the next big technological wave; as after the dot‑com crash, fundamental growth will be built by those who lay the foundations now</li>
<li>Correct timing and scale of thinking are critical: 2025 may become the “year of AI studios,” as earlier for web and mobile studios</li>
<li>The AI stack is multi‑layered: applications depend on models, models on infrastructure, and that on hardware and energy; growth in one layer pulls the others</li>
<li>Accumulated progress (3D printing, motors, batteries, GPUs) is spinning up the flywheel of AI robotics and autonomous systems</li>
<li>Freedom’s experimental unit is piloting drone delivery in Almaty and researching robot dogs and humanoids</li>
<li>Assistants are a promising field both for customers (personal agents) and for companies (the next level of call center automation)</li>
<li>Robots as a market will create demand for services, marketplaces, and spare parts; a rapid growth of the humanoid fleet is possible in the next 5 years</li>
<li>The AGI timeline is uncertain: from “tomorrow” to decades; the industry suits adventurers more than guarantee seekers</li>
<li>In the classic “battle” of startup versus giant, speed/innovation versus distribution is decisive; at scale, distribution wins</li>
<li>Freedom is building its own no‑code/low‑code AI platform (more product‑oriented than n8n) and is ready to give it to external users</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The window of opportunity in AI is open: those who experiment quickly and scale a found product in time win</li>
<li>The AI‑studio model reduces the risk and cost of PMF search and allows a transition to product once organic growth appears</li>
<li>Robotics, assistants, and medical solutions are key niches where technological readiness meets market demand</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Open external access to Freedom’s internal AI platform for partners and teams</li>
<li>Continue and expand real drone delivery pilots in Almaty with the involvement of new customers</li>
<li>Focus the experimental unit on assistants, drones, robot dogs, humanoids, and health services</li>
<li>Launch partnership programs with industrial players in robotics and attract AI enthusiasts to the team</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Submit a request for access to Freedom’s AI platform and propose pilots/POCs</li>
<li>Define the target layer of the AI stack for the startup and assemble fast experiments in an AI‑studio format</li>
<li>Formulate criteria for the transition from experiment to product (PMF signals, organic growth metrics)</li>
<li>Evaluate the distribution strategy: partner with ecosystems or develop your own channels</li>
<li>Research the dataset market for the physical world and the legal aspects of IP/licensing</li>
<li>Prepare use cases for assistants and robotics in real business processes (call center, logistics, support)</li></ul>
