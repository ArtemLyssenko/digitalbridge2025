      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed the synergy between the creative industries and venture technologies, the role of AI in scaling and exporting content, and the lack of systemic support for the creative sector compared to IT. Uniqo Play showcased an AI-dubbing case in 5 languages, and producers announced co-investments and releases of major projects. The session ended with a performance—the start of filming for the series “Цена успеха,” with a premiere planned at Digital Bridge 2026.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Identify how artificial intelligence accelerates localization and scaling of creative content to global markets</li>
<li>Show working models of monetization and distribution of Kazakhstani IP abroad</li>
<li>Form the creative-tech agenda: collaboration among producers, streaming platforms, investors, and AI teams</li>
<li>Lock in the investment and production plans for key projects (films and series)</li>
<li>Demonstrate performance-style filming in practice and engage the audience in creating the product</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Which elements of creative content production is AI optimizing today (localization, VFX, lighting, production)?</li>
<li>Can a Kazakhstani “unicorn” emerge in the creative industries, and what conditions are needed for this?</li>
<li>How to build export and distribution of original content: languages, markets (USA/China), partners, release windows?</li>
<li>What financial instruments and funds are needed for sustainable growth of the creative sector?</li>
<li>Does the creative industry need government support similar to IT, and how should it be aligned with private investment?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI dubbing from Uniqo Play makes it possible to release originals in 5 languages at once with lip synchronization, opening up export sales.</li>
<li>The Hixfield (X Hill) case illustrates that “creative-tech” can scale globally and reach unicorn status.</li>
<li>The creative sector is a borderless industry: its products scale faster than traditional industries and are not asset-dependent.</li>
<li>There is an oversupply of local content in the market; an international strategy and quality become key success factors.</li>
<li>AI reduces costs and speeds up processes (VFX, lighting, influencer matching), but a bubble of excessive funding is possible.</li>
<li>Systemic players are needed: funds, producers, streaming platforms, and venture partners to build a sustainable ecosystem.</li>
<li>Global mindset: make content for the global market from the outset, primarily in English and Chinese.</li>
<li>Co-investments and IP strategies (e.g., “Дастур 2,” “Жеты Харакшы”) demonstrate a shift from one-off releases to a portfolio approach.</li>
<li>The creative sector has proven resilient without state preferences; private capital is already entering, but the dialogue on support measures remains relevant.</li>
<li>The session ended with the start of filming for the series “Цена успеха”; viewers became part of the shot, and a publication embargo was imposed.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We should have no borders. I’m interested in speaking not for Central Asia, but for the world.” — <span class="author">Adil Nurgozhin</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The creative sector has no borders: today a project can be downloaded in Brazil, China, and the USA.” — <span class="author">Almas Zhali</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Our task is to ensure our films are not only seen but also purchased outside the country.” — <span class="author">Anara Zhunusova</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We are launching the series “Цена успеха” and will show the premiere at Digital Bridge 2026.” — <span class="author">Ernar Kurmashev</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Artificial intelligence has become a key tool for the international expansion of Kazakhstani content, primarily through high-quality localization.</li>
<li>There is a mature need for a “creative-tech-venture” link and a portfolio investment model in IP aimed at the global market.</li>
<li>The creative ecosystem is forming rapidly: streaming platforms, funds, and producers are building production and distribution chains.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Filming of the series “Цена успеха” was launched right on the forum stage; viewers became extras.</li>
<li>The premiere of the series “Цена успеха” is scheduled for Digital Bridge 2026; a publication embargo has been imposed on materials from the shoot.</li>
<li>Uniqo Play is scaling AI dubbing and prioritizing translation of its own originals into 5+ languages for export.</li>
<li>Tolqyn Film Fund and Brave Talents confirm co-investments and the release of “Дастур 2” (premiere on December 25) and the launch of “Жеты Харакшы.”</li>
<li>The industry focus is shifting to the global market: developing content in English/Chinese and preparing for international distribution.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Uniqo Play: formulate and publish a slate of releases with AI dubbing in 5 languages, including the platform’s originals.</li>
<li>Producer teams: prepare international packages (materials, trailers, subs/dubs) for Cannes and other markets.</li>
<li>Tolqyn Film Fund and partners: close financing and production schedules for “Жеты Харакшы,” “Алдар Косе,” “Ауру.”</li>
<li>Create a “creative-tech” working group (streaming platforms, funds, AI teams) to share pipelines and best practices.</li>
<li>Develop a global marketing strategy (USA/China/Turkey/UAE): targeting, influencers, performance channels.</li>
<li>Initiate dialogue with the state on support measures for the creative industry, synchronized with private investment.</li></ul>
