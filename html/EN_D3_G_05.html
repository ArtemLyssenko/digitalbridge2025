      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel showed how the combination of drones and AI is already changing security, logistics, and infrastructure: the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan has deployed operator training and is streamlining NLAs; Freedom Lifestyle has launched R&D and the first deliveries by cargo drones; Kazakhtelecom uses a fleet of UAVs for road control, flood response, and ecology; all participants agreed on the need for a national UTM system and updated rules for mass flights in cities.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Discuss the shift from pilots to scaling the use of AI-enabled drones in defense, logistics, and urban management.</li>
<li>Align regulation (registration, licensing, flight zones) and define requirements for the national UTM system.</li>
<li>Expand training of UAV operators and technical specialists through «Сарбас плюс» and private schools.</li>
<li>Establish industry–government cooperation via Defence Tech for pilots and deployments.</li>
<li>Assess the prerequisites for local production/assembly of drones given consolidated demand.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How is the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan structuring UAV development and AI integration, including operator training and NLAs?</li>
<li>What mechanisms are needed to legalize and scale the number of operators in the civil sector?</li>
<li>Is drone delivery hype or an operationally and economically realistic service?</li>
<li>What regulatory barriers in Astana and Almaty impede mass flights, and how can they be removed?</li>
<li>How to ensure safety with hundreds of simultaneous flights, and what role will a national UTM system play?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>A UAV development department has been established within the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan; civil regulation is handled by the Ministry of Transport/Civil Aviation Committee (CAC), and military regulation by the MoD (especially in wartime).</li>
<li>The «Сарбас плюс» program has been launched: training UAV operators, communications specialists, and technical personnel based at an Air Defense unit in Almaty; applications via MyArmy.kz, upgraded infrastructure, and employment opportunities.</li>
<li>Defence Tech acts as a “bridge” between the security/defense sector and startups: incubation, acceleration, and piloting of solutions; expanding presence in Astana Hub and launching an office in Almaty.</li>
<li>Freedom Lifestyle is conducting R&D on cargo drones, has completed theory for 3rd-category operators, and is launching practice and licensing jointly with the Aviation Administration of Kazakhstan (AAK); the goal is regular deliveries within a 3–4 km radius from warehouses by the end of the year.</li>
<li>Delivery economics are still in R&D: technologies are expected to become cheaper over a 2–3 year horizon; the key bottleneck is a dense network of dark stores and standardized 10×10 m pads.</li>
<li>Platforms used: DJI and ARC; customization is required (winch, rain resistance) for local conditions and scenarios.</li>
<li>Kazakhtelecom operates ~60 drones for road enforcement (recording illegal overtakes), flood monitoring, forest fires, and detecting nighttime dumps in Astana; AI helps build 3D models and track dynamics.</li>
<li>Mass flights in megacities are impossible without updating rules, simplifying permits, and launching an independent national low-altitude UTM system; the industry is ready to develop a UTM and hand it over to the state.</li>
<li>Demand consolidation in national companies can justify local assembly/production, but there are questions of cost and safety requirements.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We have launched the «Сарбас плюс» program, where we train UAV operators and technical specialists.” — <span class="author">Darkhan Akhmediev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In Astana, drones record illegal dumps at night — it pays off.” — <span class="author">Ablaihan Ospanov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The combination of drones and AI already delivers measurable benefits in security, ecology, and logistics; scaling is constrained by talent and rules.</li>
<li>Mass urban flights require updated NLAs, simplified permitting procedures, and a national UTM system.</li>
<li>Industrial cooperation via Defence Tech and the participation of national companies accelerate adoption and reduce risks.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Launch joint work with the AAK and the Ministry of Transport to shape requirements for the national UTM system and simplify permitting procedures in megacities.</li>
<li>Open the Defence Tech platform to receive AI/UAV startups and organize pilots in the security/defense sector.</li>
<li>Freedom Lifestyle continues obtaining 3rd-category operator status and begins regular deliveries within a 3–4 km radius from warehouses by the end of the year.</li>
<li>Samruk-Kazyna JSC consolidates intra-holding demand for UAVs to assess the feasibility of local assembly.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Form an industry working group (MoD, Ministry of Transport/CAC/AAK, Samruk, Freedom, Kazakhtelecom, associations) on VLL and UTM rules.</li>
<li>Prepare a technical UTM roadmap: architecture, identification, corridors and buffers, integration with the CAC, reliability requirements.</li>
<li>Scale training: expand intake into «Сарбас плюс», accredit private schools, develop unified standards for 3rd-category operators.</li>
<li>Run urban BVLOS/cargo flight pilots in Almaty and on the periphery of Astana with safe routes and risk measurements.</li>
<li>Standardize pad infrastructure at warehouses (10×10 m), safety regulations, and pre-flight procedures.</li>
<li>Assemble a pool of needs from national companies and telecom operators to calculate TCO and the techno-economic justification of local assembly.</li>
<li>Prepare proposals for API submission and SLA processing of flight applications for mass delivery services.</li></ul>
