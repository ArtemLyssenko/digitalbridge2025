      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>Irving Chen presented the evolution of Unitree from pioneering quadruped robots to affordable humanoid platforms, emphasizing cost reduction and scaling the developer ecosystem. The company is shifting from supplying platforms to turnkey solutions (inspections, firefighting, emergency response) and is betting on ground/underground mobility. The key challenge is the shortage of real-world data and the gap between simulation and physics; the strategy is to combine AI models with reliable mechatronics and mass production.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Lower the barrier to entry into robotics by reducing platform costs and enabling mass production</li>
<li>Build an open application ecosystem and attract developers to humanoid robots and mobile platforms</li>
<li>Scale the deployment of solutions for inspections, safety, and emergency response in complex and hazardous environments</li>
<li>Integrate large AI models with physical robots to create "physical general AI"</li>
<li>Expand international partnerships, including collaborations with Kazakhstan and Astana Hub</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to overcome the shortage of real-world data and the gap between simulation and physical execution (sim2real)?</li>
<li>What AI model architecture will ensure reliable robot operation with limited data?</li>
<li>How to standardize the application ecosystem for humanoid and ground platforms to accelerate scaling?</li>
<li>How to ensure safety and accountability when up to 60% of low-skilled jobs are replaced by robots?</li>
<li>Which sustainable business models (CAPEX/OPEX, RaaS) are most effective for inspections and emergency response?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Unitree was founded in 2016; early quadruped developments (XDog, Laika) made the company a pioneer in global shipments of robot dogs.</li>
<li>Since 2020, the company has moved from platforms to industry solutions: inspections, firefighting, emergency response, security.</li>
<li>New products: humanoid R1 with a starting price of $5,900 (60% less than the previous generation) and the ground platform AT (~35 kg, payload >30 kg).</li>
<li>Preparing to launch a 1.8 m tall humanoid for industrial manipulation (four configurations), market launch in about a month.</li>
<li>A bet on ground and underground mobility as the next big market, philosophically similar to aerial drones.</li>
<li>The team is developing the concept of physical general AI: a combination of mechatronics, sensors, large models, and applications.</li>
<li>The scarcity and high cost of real data are key bottlenecks; simulations are cheaper, but the gap with reality remains.</li>
<li>Telepresence practice: people with disabilities are engaged to operate robots for hazardous tasks — social impact and mass scaling.</li>
<li>Unitree claims strong positions in the global market and is preparing news about IPU and going public in China for humanoid robotics.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We lower the barrier to innovation by reducing cost and enabling mass production.” — <span class="author">Irving Chen</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Ground and underground mobility will be relevant in the coming years.” — <span class="author">Irving Chen</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Our goal is for robots to operate reliably in the physical world.” — <span class="author">Irving Chen</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Sixty percent of low-skilled jobs can be replaced by robots.” — <span class="author">Irving Chen</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The market is rapidly shifting from demos to practical solutions, where mechatronic reliability and economic efficiency are critical.</li>
<li>A breakthrough in humanoid robotics requires synergy: affordable platforms, a developer ecosystem, and AI models trained on data close to reality.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Launch a 1.8 m tall humanoid robot for industrial tasks within the next month.</li>
<li>Continue the cost-reduction strategy (−60% versus the previous generation) and expansion of mass production.</li>
<li>Focus on ground and underground mobility as priority directions for solution development.</li>
<li>Expand the program to attract developers and application providers to the Unitree ecosystem.</li>
<li>Continue the practice of telerobotics with operators with disabilities for hazardous and hard-to-reach scenarios.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Open and localize SDK/tools for developers, including documentation and examples for key scenarios (inspection, emergency response).</li>
<li>Organize pilot projects in Kazakhstan together with Astana Hub (power grids, industrial sites, infrastructure facilities).</li>
<li>Launch a simulation and synthetic data generation program with subsequent validation at real test sites (reducing the sim2real gap).</li>
<li>Prepare a demonstration tour of R1 and AT for industrial customers and universities in the region.</li>
<li>Form partnerships for application development (marketplace/app catalog) for humanoids and mobile platforms.</li>
<li>Develop safety and compliance methodologies for tasks involving humans and robots, including teleoperation and emergency response regulations.</li></ul>
