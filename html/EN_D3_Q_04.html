      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how AI and AIoT are changing city governance and quality of life: from adaptive transport to air monitoring. Speakers argued for human-centricity and a “happy city” instead of technocentrism, as well as for the sovereignty of urban data. A separate emphasis was placed on the digitization of cultural heritage as a protection of identity amid climate risks and technological homogenization. Practical steps for Almaty were discussed: sensors, predictive analytics, and open dashboards.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Understand how AI and AIoT practically improve city management and quality of life</li>
<li>Define human-centric principles and metrics for smart projects (“happy city”)</li>
<li>Formulate an approach to urban data sovereignty and ethics, avoiding vendor monopolies</li>
<li>Determine how digitizing heritage strengthens the identity and resilience of cities</li>
<li>Assemble a set of actionable steps for Almaty (air quality, transport, open data)</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How is AI already transforming city governance and improving urban quality of life?</li>
<li>How can we ensure that smart cities are not only technological but also human-centric and inclusive?</li>
<li>How can we digitize and protect cultural heritage without losing the identity of cities?</li>
<li>What fundamental processes and competencies must be in place before large-scale AI deployment?</li>
<li>How can citizens and communities participate in decision-making and change everyday practices?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI as the “brain” of the city and AIoT as the “body”: vision (sensors), thinking (analytics), action (automation) — the foundation of smart operations.</li>
<li>AIoT practices: adaptive traffic lights (Barcelona), safety and incident prediction (New York, Shenzhen), blockchain electricity trading for EVs (Shenzhen), energy consumption management (Amsterdam), smart bins (Singapore).</li>
<li>Almaty: severe air pollution and traffic jams are a single problem; a wide sensor network, dashboards, and predictive analytics are needed (wind, temperature, fires, pollen).</li>
<li>Human-centricity before technology: the goal is a “happy city”; if technology doesn’t make people happier and healthier, it has failed.</li>
<li>Data sovereignty: urban data should belong to citizens; it is unacceptable to give full control to a single vendor (risk of lock-in and inefficiency).</li>
<li>Critical use of AI: the tool is “dumb” without training; hallucinations and errors are possible. Authorship, verifiability, and professional accountability are needed.</li>
<li>Cultural heritage as the soul of the city: without understanding the past, a sustainable future is impossible. AI helps analyze risks (satellites, big data), but there is a risk of homogenization and loss of identity.</li>
<li>Climate challenges are already reshaping cities (example of Ghadames, Libya); solutions must take local context into account (example of Oman, rejection of skyscrapers in favor of traditions).</li>
<li>Art and data: the city as an interwoven collaborative space; artistic practices with sensors and visualizations reveal invisible layers of data and the ethical risks of “surveillance capitalism.”</li>
<li>Changing citizen behavior is part of the solution: walking, cycling, recycling, exerting pressure on authorities through manifestos, and demanding air quality as a human right.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“If AI is the brain of the city, then the body is devices and sensors: AIoT that enables the city to see, think, and act.” — <span class="author">Zhuldyz Saulebekova</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Why a smart city and not a happy city? If technologies don’t make people happy, you have failed the task.” — <span class="author">Rikkardo Marini</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“It is impossible to build the future if you don’t have an understanding of the past.” — <span class="author">Bashaar Tarabai</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In a democratic society, a city’s data belongs to its citizens, and data is money.” — <span class="author">Rikkardo Marini</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI is a tool, like a knife in the hands of a doctor or in the hands of a criminal — we make the decisions.” — <span class="author">Zhuldyz Saulebekova</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI and AIoT significantly expand the capabilities of urban management, but their effectiveness depends on human-centric design and the maturity of foundational processes.</li>
<li>Preserving identity through digitization and storytelling of heritage is a strategic necessity amid climate and technological challenges.</li>
<li>Data sovereignty and openness, rejection of single-vendor dependence, and citizen engagement are key to a sustainable and equitable digital transformation of the city.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Adhere to a human-centric approach and the “happy city” metric when evaluating the effects of AI projects.</li>
<li>Enshrine the principle that urban data belongs to citizens; prevent transferring full control to a single vendor.</li>
<li>Expand the air quality sensor network in Almaty, and develop dashboards and predictive analytics (including for fires and pollen).</li>
<li>Launch programs for digital recording and storytelling of cultural heritage with the participation of communities and museums.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Conduct an audit of basic city processes and data before automation; train teams to work with AI and verify results.</li>
<li>Develop a city manifesto (walking, cycling, emission reduction) and an air roadmap with measurable target indicators.</li>
<li>Launch a pilot of adaptive traffic lights on key corridors (e.g., Al-Farabi), taking into account pedestrian and traffic flows in real time.</li>
<li>Create a data sovereignty policy: a registry of sensors, open APIs, access levels, and rules for reinvesting data revenues back into the city.</li>
<li>Organize a public behavior-change program: campaigns for walking/cycling, separate waste collection, and voluntary avoidance of unnecessary trips.</li>
<li>Together with Iconem and museums, launch a pilot for 3D scanning of heritage sites and creating digital exhibitions with AI storytelling.</li></ul>
