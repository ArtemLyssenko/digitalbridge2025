      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session focuses on the role of AI in Kazakhstan’s digital power strategy, the balance between innovation and safety in the new AI law, and the development of an open Digital Code. Practical cases are presented: the use of satellite land monitoring, scaling assistance to debtors with AI tools, and the «Ауыл Аманаты» program for cooperation among rural household farms. International partner Alibaba noted Kazakhstan’s advantages: flexible regulation, young talent, infrastructure, and readiness for cooperation.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Ensure a balance between development and safety through flexible AI regulation and the introduction of the Digital Code</li>
<li>Develop national digital infrastructure (compute capacity, “green” data centers) and local language models</li>
<li>Reduce digital inequality and strengthen citizens’ digital and financial literacy</li>
<li>Scale practical AI applications in the public sector and social projects (debts, healthcare, agriculture)</li>
<li>Increase transparency and accountability through open data and a unified digital legal environment</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to build a sustainable balance between AI innovation and the protection of citizens’ rights, cybersecurity, and ethics?</li>
<li>What environmental standards and energy models are needed for data centers and cooling (water, energy)?</li>
<li>How to ensure the inclusion of SMEs and creative industries in digital transformation and regulatory standards?</li>
<li>What measures will help reduce digital inequality (infrastructure, training, access to devices)?</li>
<li>Is localization of AI models needed (language, sectors) and how to incentivize the creation of national models?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Kazakhstan declares a course toward a “full-fledged digital power,” developing AI, cybersecurity, and digital public services (digital ID, e-wallet), holding 28th place in global digitalization rankings.</li>
<li>The AI law is adopted as a flexible framework: it draws on the practices of the EU, Japan, Singapore, and China, but avoids unenforceable bans, and takes copyright and model localization into account.</li>
<li>The Digital Code is the next stage: unifying rules for all industries; the text is available on GitHub (3 languages) for open commenting; the goal is to adopt the general part by the end of the year.</li>
<li>Public policy emphasizes risk reduction: cybercrime, protection of personal data, digital addiction, and digital inequality.</li>
<li>Alibaba positively assesses Kazakhstan’s “mix”: flexible regulation, predictability, young workforce, tax incentives, infrastructure, and advantageous geolocation; readiness to cooperate in the AI Council.</li>
<li>Project «Қарызсыз қоғам»: an AI bot in WhatsApp and the voice assistant «Тамору» scaled processing to about 5 thousand consultations per day; 800+ thousand requests per year, 360 thousand people received assistance; legal support, restructurings, bankruptcies, and financial literacy training.</li>
<li>Satellite and navigation land monitoring (КҒС): high/medium-resolution satellite images, the Ministry of Agriculture land map, algorithmic violation detection, land restitution, and support for farmers.</li>
<li>Program «Ауыл Аманаты»: screening of 189 districts and 2,295 rural districts; 12.7 thousand small investment projects (≈601 billion KZT by 2029), focus on cooperation among 490 thousand household farms, specialization of districts by commodity mass.</li>
<li>AI environmental agenda: the principle of energy saving is enshrined in law; emphasis on algorithm optimization, “green” data centers, and in the long term — on clean sources, including nuclear energy.</li>
<li>The party’s digital project «Цифрлық қоғам»: education on cybersecurity, combating fraud, forming “digital diet” skills, and overcoming digital inequality.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We must become a full-fledged digital power, not just use others’ digital capabilities.” — <span class="author">Daulet Karibek</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The state has expressed its regulatory stance on the technology — it is clear and transparent.” — <span class="author">Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The law on artificial intelligence will grow every six months — technologies change too fast.” — <span class="author">Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“When we plugged in AI tools, we got up to five thousand consultations a day.” — <span class="author">Ordabayev Olzhas</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Kazakhstan is building its own model of AI regulation and digital law based on international practices and local specifics (language, sectors, infrastructure).</li>
<li>Practical AI cases are already delivering scalable social impact: from financial assistance to citizens to land management and rural development.</li>
<li>Environmental and energy requirements for AI infrastructure are being integrated into regulatory principles and investment plans (“green” data centers, clean energy).</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Continue implementing the flexible AI law with a priority on safety, energy saving, and transparency.</li>
<li>Complete development of the general part of the Digital Code and submit it for approval by year-end, maintaining an open discussion format on GitHub.</li>
<li>Scale AI tools in the «Қарызсыз қоғам» project (chatbots, voice scenarios) to increase coverage and consultation quality.</li>
<li>Expand satellite-navigation land monitoring and integrate data into the Ministry of Agriculture land map to prevent violations and support the agro-industrial complex.</li>
<li>Launch a pilot “green” data center and form an approach to a network of eco-friendly data centers for national compute capacity.</li>
<li>Support the development of cooperatives under «Ауыл Аманаты» and set KPIs for project implementation at the district and rural district levels.</li>
<li>Work with Alibaba on an educational pilot on e-commerce and monetization for citizens undergoing financial recovery.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Collect and process proposals for the Digital Code draft on GitHub (3 languages), prepare the general part for submission.</li>
<li>Define technical requirements and environmental metrics for a “green” data center; conduct a feasibility study.</li>
<li>Strengthen multilingual support of AI bots (Kazakh/Russian, slang) and expand scenarios in WhatsApp/voice; set up response quality monitoring.</li>
<li>Update dashboards on satellite land monitoring and ensure regular quarterly public reports for interested agencies and the public.</li>
<li>Form a working group with Alibaba to design an online course on earning on e-commerce platforms and a pilot roadmap in the Republic of Kazakhstan.</li></ul>
