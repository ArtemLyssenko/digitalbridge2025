      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed: 1) how to safely and usefully introduce AI in schools without destroying the 'teacher–student' connection, 2) teacher training and proctoring standards as the key to quality and academic integrity, 3) a technocratic development model using Korea as an example with a focus on research universities and the 'university–industry' link, 4) student motivation (especially boys), differentiated methods, and measuring well-being and functional literacy.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Within 12–18 months, create and implement a framework for AI ethics and safe use in schools (Kazakh/Russian content and academic integrity policy).</li>
<li>Scale teacher training in AI competencies, proctoring, and plagiarism checking through a peer-to-peer model and partnerships with EdTech companies.</li>
<li>Annually measure functional literacy and NPS of students/parents in all partner schools and use the data for management decisions.</li>
<li>Launch pilot 'school–industry' research laboratories and prepare a roadmap toward opening KAS/KAIST Kazakhstan (2026 plan).</li>
<li>Deploy motivation programs and differentiated methods (including for boys and inclusion), integrating SEL and well-being practices.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to ensure that AI enhances learning and the 'teacher–student' connection rather than replacing them?</li>
<li>What proctoring and plagiarism-checking standards are applicable to schools and how can they be scaled?</li>
<li>How to balance the internationalization of education with national interests and the development of Kazakh scientific content?</li>
<li>Where to start the early technologization of education (preschool/elementary) to cultivate a research mindset?</li>
<li>How to increase student motivation and responsibility (especially for boys) through differentiated pedagogy and a culture of big goals?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI in education requires clear usage ethics: the tool should help the teacher design learning and not provide ready-made answers to the student.</li>
<li>The critical foundation is staff preparation: without systemic upskilling of teachers and administrators, technologies do not deliver results.</li>
<li>80% of EdTech startups fail due to weak data, a wrong product course, and a lack of trained personnel.</li>
<li>Functional literacy and critical thinking are protection against the 'hallucinations' of generative AI; measurements should be regular (at least once a year).</li>
<li>NPS and comments from students/parents are fast indicators of problems, especially in the 'middle grades' (grades 7–8), where new needs are formed.</li>
<li>Proctoring and anti-plagiarism standards must be implemented together with staff training and small pilots.</li>
<li>Korean technocracy model: reliance on technological universities and laboratories, close ties with industry, applied science, and commercialization.</li>
<li>The KAS/KAIST Kazakhstan research university is planned as industry-oriented, with laboratories for company orders (sensors/chips, etc.).</li>
<li>Balance of internationalization and national identity: new standards are welcome, but priority goes to national interests and the development of the Kazakh language in science.</li>
<li>Motivation of boys requires setting high expectations, experiences of overcoming difficulties, and differentiated methods; education is work, not play.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“A connection between the teacher and the student must be preserved — AI should not replace it with ready-made answers.” — <span class="author">Rauan Kenzhekhan</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“80% of startups fail due to a weak data base, a wrong course, and insufficient personnel training.” — <span class="author">Madi Kargin</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“You have to raise an Elon Musk from kindergarten — start with engineering thinking and practice.” — <span class="author">Dana Moldakulova</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Boys need big ambitious goals set from childhood and the right words of expectation.” — <span class="author">Nurmukhammed Dosybayev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Education is not a game: what matters is 'long dopamine' from daily small victories in learning.” — <span class="author">Rauan Kenzhekhan</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Without systemic teacher training and academic integrity norms, AI implementation will not yield a sustainable effect.</li>
<li>A technocratic trajectory through research universities and the 'university–industry' link is applicable in Kazakhstan and can become an economic driver.</li>
<li>Regular metrics (functional literacy, NPS, well-being) should drive decisions at the level of schools and networks.</li>
<li>Student motivation and responsibility, especially for boys, are strengthened through differentiation, high expectations, and a culture of overcoming.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Decided to scale teacher training in AI competencies and proctoring via a peer-to-peer model with the participation of EdTech partners.</li>
<li>Decided to measure functional literacy and NPS annually in all partner schools and use the findings to adjust programs.</li>
<li>Decided to launch pilots of an AI assistant for teachers (without issuing ready-made answers to students) in a number of schools.</li>
<li>Decided to form a working group to develop a framework for AI ethics and academic integrity with an emphasis on the Kazakh language and local content.</li>
<li>Decided to start preparing industry-oriented 'school–industry' laboratories as a pre-stage to launching KAS/KAIST Kazakhstan (plan-2026).</li>
<li>Decided to implement SEL and well-being programs with targeted support for the middle grades (grades 7–8) and differentiated methods by gender and inclusion.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Develop training modules and manuals on AI for teachers; conduct waves of p2p training (groups of 15–20 people) across school networks.</li>
<li>Develop and approve standards for proctoring, anti-plagiarism, and verification protocols for tests/olympiads.</li>
<li>Roll out an annual assessment cycle: functional literacy (PISA-like), NPS, and SEL/well-being questionnaires; set up analytics for comments.</li>
<li>Launch a pilot of a teacher AI assistant together with a technology partner; define impact metrics (lesson quality, teacher workload).</li>
<li>Create 2–3 pilot 'school–industry' laboratories (sensors/IoT/chip design) with the participation of 5–10 client companies.</li>
<li>Prepare a roadmap for KAS/KAIST Kazakhstan: partnerships with Korean universities, recruitment of professors, a list of laboratories, and commercialization KPIs.</li>
<li>Develop a motivation program for boys: high expectations, mentoring, a system of trials/competitions, differentiated methods.</li>
<li>Expand the network of olympiads and internal tournaments to train 'wins–losses' and resilience, integrating principles of academic integrity.</li></ul>
