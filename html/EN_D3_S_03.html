      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The discussion focuses on the role of AI in EdTech: from risks of politicization and questions of data sovereignty to practical personalization of learning and inclusion. The speakers divided AI applications into control/analytics, tools for teachers, and learner augmentation, emphasizing the need for real, not 'hype' AI assistants. They discussed gamification and the myth of a 'short attention span', as well as the balance between openness of technology and regulation to protect sensitive data.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Identify effective and safe scenarios for using AI in education for students, teachers, and management systems.</li>
<li>Form an approach to personalized learning that accounts for inclusion and the protection of sensitive data.</li>
<li>Define the boundaries of digital hygiene and data sovereignty in Kazakhstan's EdTech ecosystem.</li>
<li>Determine the priorities for EdTech transformation: gamification, outcome-based learning, and high-quality AI assistants.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Will sovereign AI become a tool of political control in education?</li>
<li>Will artificial intelligence replace teachers and schools, and what will happen to classic EdTech then?</li>
<li>How do we teach children in the 'TikTok era': is attention span really falling, and does gamification help?</li>
<li>Who is responsible for inclusion when implementing AI: the state, developers, schools, or educators?</li>
<li>Where is the line between personalization and data privacy, and how can countries with 'data poverty' compete?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>AI in EdTech has three key directions: administrative control and reporting; tools to increase teacher efficiency; personal assistants to augment the learner.</li>
<li>For adult EdTech, the 'pre-recorded video' format is becoming a thing of the past: schools that create practical AI assistants, boost engagement, and lead the student to a measurable outcome will survive.</li>
<li>Gamification and intrinsic/extrinsic motivation are key to retaining attention; personalized AI mentors cover up to 80% of a teacher's tasks.</li>
<li>The myth of a declining attention span: modern children are not weaker — they require different formats; Olympiad practice confirms concentration with the right methodology.</li>
<li>School is not only knowledge but also a social environment: even with individualization, it is important to preserve skills of empathy, communication, and teamwork.</li>
<li>Inclusion = personalization for everyone: we need student profiles, collection and analysis of sensitive data with clear rules for protection and de-identification.</li>
<li>Data sovereignty and infrastructure: local models (KZLM), servers and supercomputers in the РК, in parallel — exchange of de-identified datasets.</li>
<li>Digital hygiene is a shared responsibility: users should share data consciously; developers and government agencies should ensure security.</li>
<li>Development strategy: first stimulate technological growth (by analogy with fintech), then regulate flexibly, avoiding early overregulation.</li>
<li>Global cooperation is more important than protectionism for small markets: openness to technologies and partnerships accelerates progress and reduces the gap.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Gamification is the main trend in EdTech, and personalized AI mentors already replace up to 80% of a teacher's functions.” — <span class="author">Askar Bolat</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We should not divide children into 'neurotypical' and 'non-neurotypical': everyone has their own needs, and personalization requires sensitive data.” — <span class="author">Asem Tazhiyeva</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>AI does not cancel the role of the teacher and the school but redistributes emphasis: routine to machines, leadership, creativity, and social skills to humans.</li>
<li>Kazakhstan should develop local AI infrastructure and privacy standards while remaining open to global technologies and the exchange of de-identified data.</li>
<li>Personalization and inclusion require systematic collection of student profiles and secure processing of sensitive data.</li>
<li>EdTech effectiveness is determined not by 'hype' but by measurable student outcomes and sustainable motivation (gamification, assistants, journey support).</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Focus on creating practical AI assistants for students and teachers instead of declarative 'AI branding'.</li>
<li>Support the development of local models and infrastructure (e.g., KZLM) with priority on de-identification and sovereign data storage.</li>
<li>Begin systematic collection and maintenance of learner profiles for personalization in compliance with privacy requirements.</li>
<li>Promote digital hygiene among users and educators as a fundamental skill for working with AI tools.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Launch pilots of gamified AI tutors in schools and on supplementary education platforms with measurement of impact on course completion.</li>
<li>Develop industry standards for de-identification and storage of sensitive data (jointly with regulators and EdTech companies).</li>
<li>Create an AI upskilling program for educators (collection and analysis of learning tracks, working with assistants, digital hygiene).</li>
<li>Organize a cross-sector consortium (government agencies–business–universities–employers) for sharing best practices and datasets.</li>
<li>Deploy local computing capacities and sandboxes for safe testing of educational models.</li>
<li>Publish transparent ethical guidelines on inclusive design of AI products and procedures for informed consent.</li></ul>
