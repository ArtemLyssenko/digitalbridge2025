      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session focused on consolidating creative communities, launching infrastructure (Парк Dala Edge, GCA zone) and scaling education in game development. They discussed tax and GR initiatives for the industry, export programs, and АКИ’s research agenda. The international speaker presented monetization practices via AI and the linkage of digital and physical assets, as well as access to the markets of India and MENA.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Unite creative communities and producers across key areas (game development, esports, animation, comics, art) within АКИ and GCA.</li>
<li>Develop infrastructure: hubs and Парк креативных технологий Dala Edge as a regional techno-creative campus.</li>
<li>Achieve preferential taxation and improve the legal framework for the creative industries.</li>
<li>Scale education in creative professions and game development at the school and university levels; launch online platforms.</li>
<li>Strengthen exports of creative products and international collaborations in Central Asia and beyond.</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What tax regimes and support measures are needed for the accelerated growth of the creative industries in Kazakhstan?</li>
<li>How can we solve the problem of low visibility of projects and bring them to a wide audience domestically and abroad?</li>
<li>Which model for scaling game development education is more effective: offline hubs, university programs, or online platforms?</li>
<li>What monetization practices via AI and the linkage of digital and physical assets are applicable for local studios?</li>
<li>How best to localize products and build entry into the markets of India, MENA, and East Asia?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>АКИ consolidates the sector: 60 members, committees, an organic “producers’ club,” the regional CCN (Creative Central Asia Network).</li>
<li>Kyrgyzstan is a reference: a creative park with a 0.25% tax; Uzbekistan is actively investing (IT Park, major forums). In Kazakhstan they plan to seek incentives (VAT for creators from January 1 — 16% under the current norm).</li>
<li>Six directions of АКИ: education and incubation, infrastructure (hubs/art residencies), financing (angels/funds), GR and amendments to laws, research, alliances and partnerships.</li>
<li>Scale of education: Omnium trained 150 school teachers (game development in grades 10–11), initiatives for universities have been launched and an educational social network for game development is being created.</li>
<li>Парк креативных технологий Dala Edge (Kaskelen): 17.5 ha, clean air and ecosystem; the first resident is New York Film Academy Kazakhstan (65 students, 5 programs, -70% versus the U.S. price).</li>
<li>Dala Edge ecosystem: proximity to SDU, a planned relocation of AUES, negotiations with Korean and Chinese universities; in 3 years — up to 25 thousand students, free venues for events and the possibility of building studios of 400–500 m².</li>
<li>АКИ is developing export: agreements with «Стрейдом», use of overseas exhibition spaces (in Dubai — 3,000 m²), formation of a registry of creative spaces (25+ locations).</li>
<li>Annual flagships: World Creativity Day (112 events in 6 cities, 61 — in Astana), Eurasian Film & TV Market (streaming tracks added; Unica Play and Frida Media have appeared in Kazakhstan, OTT from Kazakhtelecom).</li>
<li>Almaty community movement: developers’ club, Akera game jams (300+ developers, budget ~3 million KZT), The Game Awards Central Asia is planned.</li>
<li>International expertise: Dr. Arijit — AI/blockchain practices, physical-digital commerce, corporate open innovation; support for entering India (Khelo India), MENA, the USA, Australia.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“One creator meets another creator, and magic is born.” — <span class="author">David Tuganov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Without money, nothing will work.” — <span class="author">David Tuganov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We trained one hundred and fifty school teachers... and starting in September they began teaching the game development program.” — <span class="author">Lev Tarasov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We gaming guys started using AI much more before any industry adopted, but somehow it's so underrated.” — <span class="author">Arijit Bhattacharya</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The creative industry in the region is maturing: consolidating communities and launching major infrastructure projects can accelerate growth.</li>
<li>The key to scaling is a combination of systemic education, preferential regulation, and sustainable financing (private funds, angels).</li>
<li>International partnerships and export showcases (Dubai, India, MENA) open new channels for monetization and project recognition.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Appoint Malika Igibaeva as the coordinator of the committee for five areas (game development, esports, animation, comics, art) and the GCA zone.</li>
<li>Парк Dala Edge provides venues for game development events free of charge; applications from communities and studios are open.</li>
<li>АКИ takes on orchestration, angel investing, and PR support for the ecosystem of Парк Dala Edge and related initiatives.</li>
<li>Launch preparations for holding The Game Awards Central Asia with the involvement of the region’s creative industries.</li>
<li>Continue scaling game development education: programs for schools (through trained teachers) and universities; development of online platforms.</li>
<li>Form a registry of creative spaces and an export program for creative products, including the use of overseas venues.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Industry participants should register in the GCA registry and contact the coordinator (Malika) to be included in the committees and event program.</li>
<li>Submit applications to hold events/residencies at Dala Edge; initiate requests to build studio spaces of 400–500 m².</li>
<li>Studios and producers should prepare showcases and demos for Pitch Point and the GCA zone, as well as materials for export showcases (including Dubai 3,000 m²).</li>
<li>Educational institutions and teachers — join Omnium’s programs, university tracks, and online platforms for game development.</li>
<li>АКИ and partners — compile and publish a complete registry of creative hubs; develop a roadmap for tax incentives and amendments to the ЗАК.</li>
<li>Teams — work out AI/physical-digital monetization models and localization for India/MENA; contact Dr. Arijit to enter their programs (Khelo India, corporate open innovation).</li></ul>
