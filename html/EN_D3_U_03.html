      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel unpacked getting started in game development: from learning and small projects to landing a publisher. They discussed that success requires systematizing knowledge, discipline, and realistic timeline/budget estimates. They showed the differences between paths—web/mobile with fast prototypes, Steam projects with a vertical slice, as well as the role of marketing and market analytics. They agreed that the team and demand validation matter more than the 'perfect idea', and that trends only make sense when matched against timelines and genre.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Show practical starting paths for indie developers (web, mobile, Steam) and the requirements for a minimum result</li>
<li>Clarify the role of learning, internships, and systematizing knowledge for rapid skill growth</li>
<li>Form an approach to market analysis and hypothesis validation before large-scale development</li>
<li>Discuss funding models: publishers, own funds, grants/funds, and budget benchmarks</li>
<li>Provide recommendations on combining a day job with development and building a sustainable team</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Where to start making games and where to learn if you have little experience?</li>
<li>How do indie games differ from 'non-indie' and how to transition to large projects?</li>
<li>How to combine a day job and indie development without burnout and missed deadlines?</li>
<li>Follow trends or make a game 'from the heart'—how to find balance and a market?</li>
<li>How to cheaply test the demand for an idea and estimate realistic timelines/budgets?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Indie is first and foremost independence from a publisher; team size does not define 'indie' (e.g., large independent companies).</li>
<li>It’s better to start with small projects (web/mobile), where you can get experience, traffic, and first revenue faster; web platforms (including Яндекс Игры) provide organic traffic.</li>
<li>In mobile, organic is limited: without marketing and/or a publisher, launching is hard and expensive; finding a publisher is critical.</li>
<li>Beginners inevitably underestimate timelines: it’s reasonable to multiply the initial estimate by 5–6; plan in stages (prototype → vertical slice → market fit → production).</li>
<li>For Steam and PC games, the business model and genre discipline are important; market orientation is as important as the 'how'.</li>
<li>Trends are useful for quick small games; for long projects (3+ years), following fleeting trends is ineffective—evergreen genre values matter more.</li>
<li>The 70/20/10 rule: 70% — genre foundation, 20% — refinement of known mechanics, 10% — a new mechanic; this increases the chances of market acceptance.</li>
<li>Indie budgets vary widely: from very simple (up to ~1 million rubles with juniors) to $50–100k and above; marketing and the team are the main risk factors.</li>
<li>Validate demand before building the 'dream' project: fake gameplay and creative tests, niche analytics (Sensor Tower, AppMagic, SteamDB), and the structure of top charts/organic.</li>
<li>The team is more important than the idea: sustainable results emerge through regular work, internships, knowledge sharing, and living in a professional environment.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“You won't be able to estimate timelines correctly—multiply them by five to six and plan in stages.” — <span class="author">Strebulaev Ilya</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Educational courses are a fast way to systematize knowledge and get accurate information from production.” — <span class="author">Lev Tarasov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>The market imposes high demands on discipline and analytics: starting with small formats and validating demand is the most rational path.</li>
<li>For long-term projects, genre robustness and the quality of the vertical slice matter more than chasing fleeting trends.</li>
<li>Financing and marketing determine survivability: a publisher, web organic, creative tests, and developing your own team increase the odds.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Agreed as recommendations: beginners should start with small web/mobile projects and/or internships at studios.</li>
<li>It was decided to focus on mandatory market analysis and hypothesis testing (fake gameplay, analytics services) before large-scale development.</li>
<li>The Cyber Temple team moved the release of Dark Switch to the spring of next year.</li>
<li>The Cyber Temple studio identified the choice of publisher as the next fork (between Focus Entertainment and Kepler Interactive) with the goal of signing by year-end.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Compile and share with participants a list of analytics tools and platforms (Sensor Tower, AppMagic, SteamDB, GameStats, Яндекс Игры).</li>
<li>Organize a practical workshop on planning development stages (prototype → vertical slice → market fit) and estimating timelines/budgets.</li>
<li>Launch a pilot of internships/mentorship tracks for juniors on live projects (via GCA/Omnium and the speakers' studios).</li>
<li>Prepare pitch deck templates and a checklist for choosing a publisher (metrics, build, marketing strategy, timelines).</li>
<li>Run interest tests with fake gameplay for 2–3 participant hypotheses and review the results at the next meeting.</li></ul>
