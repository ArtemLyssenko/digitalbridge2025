      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed that the development of esports is determined by game publishers and content rights; the role of the state is to create conditions and not contradict the rights holders’ rules. Kazakhstan balances between the “people’s” PC CS2 scene and the mass mobile segment (PUBG Mobile, MLBB), with infrastructure issues (servers, ping) and the club model being critical. Separate blocks were devoted to investment and monetization, women’s esports (Female Pro League), engaging youth through education/academies, and international expansion (the PGL effect, the Game of Drones franchise).</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Define the optimal role of the state and engagement with publishers in developing esports in Kazakhstan</li>
<li>Identify the most promising investment areas (PC, mobile segment, women’s leagues, infrastructure)</li>
<li>Discuss pathways to reach the international level and reduce infrastructure barriers (servers, ping, bootcamps in the EU)</li>
<li>Form approaches to monetization (tournaments, brands, product placement, franchise) and to growing the club ecosystem</li>
<li>Define mechanics for inclusion and education: women’s leagues, school–student leagues, academies, and media skills</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What role should the state and federations play in an industry where key rights belong to game publishers?</li>
<li>Which segments and disciplines are most promising for investment in Kazakhstan: PC or mobile esports?</li>
<li>How to solve the infrastructure problem (local servers, ping), and do teams need to relocate to Europe?</li>
<li>Which model is more effective for the market: the club system or an emphasis on national teams and state programs?</li>
<li>What workable monetization models apply to new forms of esports (the Game of Drones example)?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Publishers are the main force in esports: game rights define competition formats and tournament requirements</li>
<li>State programs are viable only in cooperation with rights holders; otherwise implementation stalls</li>
<li>CS2 is the “people’s” discipline in Kazakhstan, but by mass metrics the leader is PUBG Mobile; the mobile segment is growing fast</li>
<li>Infrastructure is critical: the lack of local servers in key PC titles and high ping to Europe limit growth</li>
<li>Tencent’s approach in PUBG Mobile (local servers and dedicated slots) eases the path to the international stage</li>
<li>Women’s esports requires systemic support: the launch of the Female Pro League fills the vacuum after ESL Impact</li>
<li>Monetization: brands, product placement, and hybrid “free to play/paid to compete” models (Game of Drones case)</li>
<li>The club model and the development of local organizations stimulate the market more than a focus on “national teams”</li>
<li>Media capital matters no less than results: players, commentators, and clubs need a content strategy</li>
<li>The “PGL effect” increased interest from the state and brands; the potential to attract major TOs and tourism has been proven</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“As the game publisher says, so it will be; the only way to develop anything around a game is to cooperate with the publisher.” — <span class="author">Evgeny Bogatyrev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Esports is a combination of sports, technology, and business.” — <span class="author">Kelly Cliff</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We built technology to control real cars, robots, and drones over the Internet.” — <span class="author">Abylaikhan Zhakhanov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“According to my data, the most popular game in Kazakhstan is PUBG Mobile, and CS is our people’s game.” — <span class="author">Evgeny Bogatyrev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“After the tournament, we got a stable phrase — the PGL effect.” — <span class="author">Alisher Kairbekov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Kazakhstani esports needs a publisher–infrastructure bundle (local servers, slots) and a strengthened club ecosystem.</li>
<li>Market growth will be accelerated by women’s leagues, clubs’ media strategies, and new hybrid disciplines (including real arenas and franchising).</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>ALINERS is forming a women’s roster to participate in the Female Pro League.</li>
<li>Game of Drones confirms a dual strategy: competitive online racing and narrative products; scaling via franchise.</li>
<li>Participants support prioritizing cooperation with publishers when planning state initiatives and tournaments.</li>
<li>Industry focus: developing clubs and local organizations instead of relying on national-team models.</li>
<li>It is recommended to secure placement of local servers and dedicated slots in key disciplines through negotiations with publishers.</li>
<li>Support the expansion of Kazakhstan’s calendar of significant tournaments with an emphasis on attracting international operators (including PGL 2026).</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Initiate working groups with publishers (Valve, Tencent, Moonton) on local servers and slots for Kazakhstan/CA.</li>
<li>Prepare clubs for European qualifiers: bootcamp plans, relocation logistics, and partnerships with EU arenas.</li>
<li>Launch recruitment and selection into women’s rosters (ALINERS and other clubs) for the Female Pro League season.</li>
<li>Game of Drones: package the franchise model, select 2–3 pilot international venues, and prepare brand packages for product placement.</li>
<li>Create guides for schools and parents: safe entry of children into esports, balance of study and training, choice of disciplines.</li>
<li>Develop media plans for players/casters: portfolios, community casts, applications to Paragon/MySkill; a centralized talent selection form.</li>
<li>Form a calendar of local/CA tournaments with HLTV coverage and integrations of global brands (including betting within regulation).</li></ul>
