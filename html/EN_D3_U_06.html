    <h1>Gamedev in Uzbekistan</h1>

      <span class="speaker-name">Akmal Salikhov</span>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The session showed how in recent years the gamedev ecosystem in Uzbekistan has taken shape: tax incentives and exports, growth in the number of studios, and an indie uptick. The results of a survey of indie teams (composition, genres, engines, pain points) were presented and gaps in last‑mile financing and education were discussed. Special emphasis was placed on practical cases and trends: profitable genres, a 2D renaissance, as well as the synergy of AI (Claude MCP) and Unity to accelerate prototyping and production.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Provide an overview of the state of Uzbekistan’s gamedev and its export potential against the backdrop of reforms and incentives</li>
<li>Identify key barriers for indie teams: financing, education, visibility</li>
<li>Share indie survey data and practical recommendations on genres, engines, and production</li>
<li>Show the capabilities of AI tools (Claude MCP + Unity) for small teams</li>
<li>Consolidate the community around an open report and further joint steps</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>Why does it make sense to build a career and studios in Uzbekistan instead of relocating?</li>
<li>How can indies close the 'last mile' of financing and correctly assess a project for investors?</li>
<li>Which genres and platforms are more rational for indies today (and what to avoid)?</li>
<li>What government support measures and educational initiatives does Uzbekistan’s gamedev need?</li>
<li>How do AI (Claude MCP) and Unity change prototyping efficiency and team size?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>Demographics and safety create the foundation: 38 million population, 55% youth; a multinational environment and affordable daily life.</li>
<li>Government reforms and IT Park Uzbekistan incentives substantially reduce the payroll burden, which attracts exporters.</li>
<li>The gamedev sector is visible in IT exports: according to IT Park — about 600 employed; on GameDevMap for Tashkent — ~12 companies; total residents with the activity type 'games' — around 27 (noisy data).</li>
<li>East Games is the first large studio with an office 'not in a basement'; content outsourcing chains are forming for major titles (example: the contribution of a Tashkent team to World of Warships).</li>
<li>Survey of ~50 indie teams: average team size — 3 people; profiles are diverse, but there is an oversupply of 'self‑declared' game designers; there are no women in 70% of teams.</li>
<li>Indie genre plans diverge from market monetization: few city‑builders, an excess of platformers; the fact of platformer oversaturation on Steam is ignored.</li>
<li>Engines: Unity dominates; Unreal is unpopular; stylized 3D prevails; the potential of modern 2D is underestimated (cases like Dave the Diver).</li>
<li>Main release barriers: lack of money for the final phase, team breakups, underestimation of scope and a shortage of time/motivation; critical 'bridge' funding of $5–10k for polishing.</li>
<li>Education and visibility are weak spots: no specialized gamedev grants and schools in Uzbek; Russian‑language content is not accessible to everyone.</li>
<li>Compensation: in large studios, a premium to market and release bonuses; for indies — lower fixed pay but possible options; a benchmark for a junior in Tashkent is ~$400–600.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“Canada would make not 100 games a year, but 101. And if there was one game in Uzbekistan, thanks to me there are three — that’s impact.” — <span class="author">Akmal Salikhov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“The money is in city‑builders, not in platformers. Everyone knows: never make platformers — there are thousands of them on Steam.” — <span class="author">Akmal Salikhov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“AI and Unity are like bread and Rama: made for each other.” — <span class="author">Akmal Salikhov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Teams are small — three people on average — and that’s good for the coming AI revolution.” — <span class="author">Akmal Salikhov</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“It’s very frustrating: there’s already smoke, but we can’t get it to fire — we’re short of the notorious ten thousand dollars for release.” — <span class="author">Akmal Salikhov</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Uzbekistan’s gamedev ecosystem has formed and is growing thanks to incentives and exports, but it runs into a shortage of specialized education and targeted funding for indies.</li>
<li>The market needs 'last‑mile' instruments (micro‑grants, seed checks) and genre‑market discipline among indies (fewer platformers, more economically sustainable genres).</li>
<li>AI (Claude MCP) paired with Unity radically accelerates prototyping, reducing team size and the cost of experiments.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Publish an open report on the survey of Uzbekistan’s indie teams by the end of October and distribute it through East Games/incubator channels.</li>
<li>Hold an open roundtable on October 20 to discuss the survey results and develop support measures.</li>
<li>Initiate the development of a targeted gamedev grant with IT Park/sectoral institutes, separate from the general presidential grants.</li>
<li>Continue updating GameDevMap and call on regional studios (including Astana) to add themselves to the directory.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Compile and send out the full indie survey report; prepare infographics (studios, employment, engines, genres, finances).</li>
<li>Launch a pilot of micro‑grants ($5–10k) for projects with a vertical slice/Steam page/wishlists.</li>
<li>Organize a series of workshops on genre validation and unit economics (city‑builders, the 2D renaissance, service metrics LTV/CAC).</li>
<li>Run a practical masterclass on Claude MCP + Unity (installation, a prototype in 1–3 days, editor‑script pipeline).</li>
<li>Launch a mentoring program on game design and production in Uzbek/English; prepare a basic course.</li>
<li>Compile and publish an annual salary benchmark for Uzbekistan’s gamedev (by grades and roles).</li></ul>
