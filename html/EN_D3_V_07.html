    <h1>The Question as the Engine of Innovation: AI in Education and Startups</h1>

  <div class="speaker-badge">
    <div>
      <span class="speaker-name">Pol Kim</span>
      <span class="speaker-role"> — Associate Dean and Chief Technology Officer of the Stanford Graduate School of Education</span>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>Pol Kim showed how asking the right questions becomes the foundation of innovation and entrepreneurship in the age of AI. Through examples—from a robot dog to a fifth grader who built a prototype with ChatGPT and Replit—he demonstrated the democratization of solution creation. The SMILE platform from Stanford was presented to strengthen the skill of posing creative questions and organizing group work. There was a call to think 2–3 years ahead and apply the 'lenses of time and stakeholders' using the examples of the Kazakhstani companies UnGrow and Smart Mining.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Reorient the audience toward posing fundamental and creative questions as the basis of learning and innovation</li>
<li>Show practical ways to rapidly implement ideas with AI (e.g., ChatGPT + Replit)</li>
<li>Introduce the SMILE platform for evaluating question quality and organizing group work</li>
<li>Encourage the Kazakhstani ecosystem to think on a 2–3-year horizon and prepare products for future norms</li>
<li>Encourage cross-industry transfer of solutions and a mission-driven approach to launching startups</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>What high-quality questions do we formulate when encountering a new phenomenon (e.g., companion robots), and who are their stakeholders?</li>
<li>How can AI genuinely enhance the creativity of students and entrepreneurs, rather than becoming an end in itself?</li>
<li>What inefficiencies and bottlenecks in processes can we eliminate with AI today?</li>
<li>What will the 'new normal' look like in 2–3 years, and what products/services will be needed around it?</li>
<li>What next steps are logical for local companies (UnGrow, Smart Mining) given the lens of time and impact on industries?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>In the AI era, competitive advantage comes not from access to answers but from the ability to ask fundamental, previously unasked questions.</li>
<li>Fifth-grader example: ChatGPT converts an idea into code, and Replit rapidly assembles and deploys a prototype—the barriers to entry drop sharply.</li>
<li>Companion robots (robot dog) are a multifunctional platform: learning, security, emotional support; at the same time, questions of privacy and ethics arise.</li>
<li>SMILE (smile.stanford.edu) evaluates question quality, suggests improvements, and automates group activities for collective thinking.</li>
<li>A culture of questions (example: Google Dory) strengthens organizational innovativeness: 'questions are more important than answers.'</li>
<li>Framework for startups: eliminating inefficiencies, improving processes, cross-industry transfer of ideas, mission-driven focus, as well as the lenses of time and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Education is the second-largest industry globally; AI in EdTech is growing rapidly and opening substantial windows of opportunity.</li>
<li>Kazakhstani cases: UnGrow (vertical farms) and Smart Mining (predictive maintenance) should already be designing their product lines for future scenarios (space agriculture, carbon credits, environmental monitoring).</li>
<li>AI is a tool, not a goal: technologies serve to solve problems and create value, not to drive self-serving implementation.</li>
<li>Collective work on questions (via SMILE/communities) makes it possible to find innovative angles more quickly and move to prototyping.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“First and foremost, we must ask good questions.” — <span class="author">Pol Kim</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Imagination equals creation.” — <span class="author">Pol Kim</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“Artificial intelligence is not an end in itself.” — <span class="author">Pol Kim</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Strong questions are the main catalyst for learning and entrepreneurial innovation; AI merely accelerates the path from idea to prototype.</li>
<li>Platforms like SMILE systematically develop the skill of posing questions and collectively seeking solutions.</li>
<li>It is important for local companies to look 2–3 years ahead, using the lenses of time and stakeholders, in order to create products for the future norm.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>The principle 'AI is a tool, not a goal' has been adopted as a guideline for evaluating initiatives and projects.</li>
<li>It has been decided to develop a culture of questions in communities and teams (in the spirit of the Google Dory practice).</li>
<li>It has been decided to use SMILE to form groups and train the skill of posing creative questions in the local ecosystem.</li>
<li>It has been decided to consider strategies on a 2–3-year horizon when planning product lines (using UnGrow and Smart Mining as examples).</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Create a Kazakhstani group in SMILE and compile a pool of 50–100 creative questions for priority industries.</li>
<li>Hold 2–3 pilot workshops (universities/schools/incubators) on rapid prototyping with ChatGPT + Replit.</li>
<li>Form a working subgroup on ethics and privacy around companion robots and AI assistants.</li>
<li>For UnGrow and Smart Mining, prepare 24–36-month roadmaps with hypotheses for new markets (carbon credits, environmental monitoring, space agriculture).</li>
<li>Publish an open registry of 'future questions' for Kazakhstan and update it quarterly.</li>
<li>Organize mentoring sessions with Pol Kim and experts to evaluate the best questions and turn them into prototypes.</li></ul>
