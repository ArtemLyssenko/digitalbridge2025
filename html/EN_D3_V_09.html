      <h2>Annotation</h2>
      <p>The panel discussed how AI is transforming talent development and retention in Kazakhstan: from hybrid learning models at universities to corporate AI platforms for personalization and analytics. The real estate development sector highlighted the value of hands-on applied skills and unique solutions amid digitalization. Startup approaches accelerate automation (for example, call centers), while simultaneously creating reskilling challenges. Participants agreed on the need for collaboration between universities, corporations, and startups to shape a new type of human capital.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul><li>Define the role of AI in shaping human capital and new learning models</li>
<li>Align approaches to personalization and evaluation of learning effectiveness using AI</li>
<li>Outline mechanisms for retaining and developing talent in Kazakhstan through strong projects and ecosystem partnerships</li>
<li>Form strategies for reskilling/upskilling for youth and specialists 35+</li>
<li>Identify areas where AI automates routine while humans retain unique value</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <ul><li>How to integrate AI into educational programs without 'using AI for the sake of AI' and academic misuse?</li>
<li>What roles remain for instructors and managers in the hybrid 'human + AI' model?</li>
<li>Which corporate learning tools with AI genuinely improve productivity and employee retention?</li>
<li>How can Kazakhstan retain and bring back talent by building companies competitive in employee experience and task complexity?</li>
<li>Which professions and functions will be disrupted first, and how to organize timely reskilling (including 35+)?</li></ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul><li>The future of higher education is hybrid: AI takes over routine and personalization, while the instructor preserves mentorship, emotions, and the development of leadership competencies.</li>
<li>The risk of AI misuse in education (students and instructors 'delegating' work to chatbots) requires new rules and a culture of use.</li>
<li>Universities need to become platforms: connecting academia, industry, and startups for innovation and the formation of communities of practice.</li>
<li>Freedom Broker has implemented an internal AI learning platform: personalization of tracks, accelerated content creation, analytics/dashboards, and linkage to grades and compensation.</li>
<li>BI Group has been implementing a digitalization strategy since 2019 and in parallel is developing BuildX — a center for applied skills in skilled trades, emphasizing the value of 'artifacts made by hand'.</li>
<li>The human advantage is unique experience and context, communications, and cross-functional ties that AI does not yet reproduce.</li>
<li>Startups based on LLM agents (for example, Atlante AI) are already automating call centers and similar processes; this requires retraining programs for employees being freed up.</li>
<li>To retain talent, competitive take-home income, strong projects, and the technological maturity of companies within the country are needed.</li>
<li>A large 'baby-boom' cohort will soon enter the labor market; universities and businesses will need to scale seats and training.</li>
<li>AI proficiency is becoming a basic meta-competency in hiring; without it, a candidate loses in effectiveness.</li></ul>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      
  <blockquote>“We should not use AI for the sake of AI.” — <span class="author">Kanat Kozhakhmet</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In the next ten years, universities that only do classical teaching are doomed.” — <span class="author">Kanat Kozhakhmet</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“For us, artificial intelligence is already an absolutely simple routine work tool.” — <span class="author">Zhanna Kashenova</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We differ from artificial intelligence in that we can make artifacts with our hands.” — <span class="author">Olga Baspayeva</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“In Kazakhstan, living rich is cheaper.” — <span class="author">Beibit Baktygaliev</span></blockquote>


  <blockquote>“We do not have learning for the sake of learning — it affects your career track.” — <span class="author">Zhanna Kashenova</span></blockquote>


      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <ul><li>Synergy between universities, corporations, and startups is key to training personnel capable of working in the 'human + AI' paradigm.</li>
<li>AI should be directed toward personalization and routine tasks, leaving humans with leadership, mentorship, and unique practical skills.</li>
<li>Automation will inevitably shift employment; systemic reskilling programs are necessary for youth and mid-career specialists.</li>
<li>Talent retention is possible through technologically advanced projects, transparent career tracks, and competitive compensation.</li></ul>

      <h2>Decisions Made</h2>
      <ul><li>Create a Narxoz–Freedom Broker–BI Group–Atlante AI collaboration for joint internship tracks, guest lectures, and project-based learning.</li>
<li>Launch a pilot for call center automation with a parallel reskilling program to transition freed-up employees into analytical and client-facing roles.</li>
<li>BI University will expand BuildX and test an AI bot for building career trajectories together with mentors.</li>
<li>Form a working group with the Council on Youth Policy under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan for youth employment and career guidance projects.</li></ul>

      <h2>Action Items</h2>
      <ul><li>Hold a coordination meeting of speakers and partners (within 30 days) to approve the roadmap.</li>
<li>Compile a competency map: which AI and applied skills will be required across sectors over the next 12–24 months.</li>
<li>Develop and launch an AI Literacy module for instructors and managers (ethics, productivity, quality control).</li>
<li>Align and announce joint internship and mentorship programs with quotas for students and 35+ specialists.</li>
<li>Define pilot metrics (time to learn, productivity, career transitions, retention) and implement monitoring dashboards.</li></ul>
